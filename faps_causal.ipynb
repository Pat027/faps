While \\nstencil printing and screen printing are the most common methods, the paste can also \\nbe applied by dispensing or by a jet. \\nIn stencil printing a rigid stencil commonly made of stainless steel with a thickness of \\naround 150 µm is used. The stencil has apertures which are created by etching, laser \\ncutting or in a galvanic process. The stencil is positioned on top of the PCB in direct \\ncontact. Solder paste is added onto the stencil and is pushed across the stencil by \\nusing a squeegee. The squeegee also generates a downward pressure onto the solder \\npaste which pushes it through the stencil apertures onto the pads of the PCB [54].  \\nThe main difference of screen printing is that it uses a flexible, fine-meshed screen with \\na mesh size of about 55 µm which is not in direct contact with the PCB [54]. The mesh \\nusually has a distance of 1 mm to 1.5 mm to the surface of the PCB. The squeegee \\nlocally deforms the mesh towards the top of the PCB and pushes the solder paste \\nthrough the screen opening. When the mesh lifts off again the solder is transferred out \\nof the mesh and onto the pad [55]. \\n \\nFigure 22: Comparison of stencil printing and screen printing adapted from [50] \\n', metadata={'subject': '', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word für Microsoft 365', 'total_pages': 148.0, 'keywords': '', 'trapped': '', 'encryption': None, 'modDate': \"D:20211130144525+01'00'\", 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'file_path': 'English_Documents/student thesis/ProjectThesis_of_Dataset.pdf', 'source': 'ProjectThesis_of_Dataset.pdf', 'creationDate': \"D:20211130144525+01'00'\", 'title': '', 'page': 36.0, 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word für Microsoft 365', 'author': 'wu16bici'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2.1   Technologische und wirtschaftliche Gründe für den Einsatz von THT-Bauteilen in der \\nFlachbaugruppenfertigung \\n11 \\n[15, 21, 28]. Die reduzierte Zuverlässigkeit und verstärkte Rissbildung [29], \\nFehlstellenbildung (engl. Voids), überschüssige Lotreste [27] sowie ver-\\nmehrte Flussmittelrückstände aus der Lotpaste sind verfahrensbedingte \\nNachteile von THR. Insbesondere ist die Einsatzmöglichkeit einiger Bau-\\nteiltypen und -materialien, wie etwa Elektrolyte in Elektrolytkondensato-\\nren, LCD-Displays oder THT-Folienkondensatoren, durch mangelnde \\nWärmebeständigkeit eingeschränkt [15, 30]. Die Werkstoffeigenschaften \\nvon Vergussmassen, Ferritkernen in Spulen und Elektrolyt erlauben keine \\nhohen Temperaturen, wie sie im Reflowofen vorherrschen [31]. Zudem sind \\ndie Bauteilabmessungen im Reflowöfen durch die Durchfahrthöhe auf ty-\\npischerweise ca. 30-40 mm begrenzt. Bei größerer Durchfahrthöhe wären \\naufgrund des schlechteren Wärmeeintrags wiederum noch höhere Über-\\ntemperaturen in der Peak-Zone notwendig. Der notwendige Energieeintrag \\nfür eine Lötverbindung steht somit der Lötwärmebeständigkeit der Bau-\\nteile gegenüber [13]. Größere thermische Massen und verdeckte Lötstellen \\nverhindern den Wärmeeintrag über Luftkonvektion und müssen daher mit \\nVerfahren mit größerem Wärmeenergieeintrag gelötet werden. Somit kön-\\nnen nur bestimmte THT-Bauteile im THR-Verfahren verarbeitet werden. \\nBei Flow-Lötverfahren wird die Verbindung durch das simultane Einbrin-\\ngen des flüssigen Lotes und der damit einhergehenden Wärme hergestellt. \\nDazu gehören das Wellenlöten, Wellenlöten mit Maske, Multiwellenlöten \\nund das Selektivwellenlöten. \\nBeim Wellenlöten wird die Baugruppe unterseitig über eine stehende Lot-\\nwelle gefahren. Dadurch wird die gesamte Baugruppe erwärmt und die \\nTHT-Bauteile gelötet. Das Lötprogramm muss derart abgestimmt werden, \\ndass es den Anforderungen aller Lötstellen hinsichtlich Lötwärmebedarf \\nund Lötwärmebeständigkeit gleichermaßen genügt [12]. Damit ist die Fle-\\nxibilität eingeschränkt, auf besondere thermische Anforderungen einzel-\\nner Lötstellen auf einer Baugruppe einzugehen [30]. Der große thermische \\nSchock beim Kontakt der gesamten Baugruppe mit der Lotwelle kann zu-\\ndem thermomechanische Spannungen und Verzug verursachen, was durch \\nproduktspezifische Niederhalter verhindert werden kann [10]. Durch die \\nsimultane Lötung aller Lötstellen ist das Verfahren verglichen mit weiter \\nunten genannten Selektivverfahren pro Lötstelle kostengünstig. Die Wel-\\nlenlötanlagen verursachen jedoch höhere Wartungsaufwände als z. B. \\nSMT-Reflow-Prozesse in der Flachbaugruppenfertigung [3, 32].  \\nDurch Einsetzen der Baugruppe in eine Lötmaske mit produktspezifischen \\nÖffnungen auf der Lötseite können THT-Bauteile auf beidseitig SMT-be-\\nstückten Baugruppen auch in einer Wellenlötanlage gelötet werden.

Ebenso, wenn eine Durchkontaktierung nicht \\nden Vorgaben aus dem Layer-Setup folgt, also zum Beispiel die Via-Länge (bei Blind- \\nund Buried-Vias) nicht stimmt.\\n•\\t Micro Via Size: Der Bohrdurchmesser des Micro-Vias liegt unterhalb des im Sizes-\\nTab angegebenen Wertes für „Min. Micro Via“.\\n•\\t No Vector Font: Die Font-Prüfung (Design-Regeln, Misc-Tab) stellt fest, dass ein \\nText in einem Signallayer nicht mit der EAGLE-internen Vektor-Schrift geschrieben \\nwurde.\\nSollen mit dem CAM-Prozessor Fertigungsdaten erzeugt werden, müssen die Texte in \\nSignallayern mit dem Vektor-Font dargestellt werden, denn nur diesen kann der CAM-\\nProzessor verarbeiten. Die fertige Platine sieht in diesem Fall nicht so aus, wie diese im \\nLayout-Editor-Fenster dargestellt wurde. Man ändert entweder die Schriftart über den \\nBefehl „CHANGE FONT“ oder aktivieren im Menü „Optionen/Benutzeroberfläche“ die \\nOption „Immer Vektor-Schrift“. Bei aktivierter Option zeigt der Layout-Editor alle Texte \\nim Vektor-Font und so sieht auch die gefertigte Platine aus.\\nMan aktiviert zusätzlich die Suboption In diese Zeichnung einprägen, wird die Ein-\\nstellung im BRD-File gespeichert. Gibt man dann die Datei beispielsweise an einen \\nLeiterplattenhersteller zur Erzeugung von Fertigungsdaten weiter, wird auch an seinem \\nSystem automatisch der Vektor-Font dargestellt.\\n•\\t No real vector font: Die Font-Prüfung (Design-Regeln, Misc-Tab) stellt fest, \\ndass ein Text in einem Signallayer nicht mit der EAGLE-internen Vektor-Schrift-\\nart geschrieben wurde, obwohl er im Editorfenster als Vektor-Schriftart angezeigt \\nist. Diese Situation entsteht, wenn die Option „Immer Vektor-Schrift“ im Menü \\n„Optionen/Benutzeroberfläche“ aktiviert ist.\\n•\\t Off Grid: Das Objekt liegt nicht im aktuell eingestellten Raster. Diese Prüfung kann \\nin den Design-Regeln (Misc-Tab) ein- bzw. ausgeschaltet werden. Spätestens, wenn \\nman bedrahtete und SMD-Bauteile miteinander auf der Platine verwendet, ist diese \\nPrüfung nicht mehr sinnvoll und sie ist daher standardmäßig ausgeschaltet.\\n•\\t Overlap: Berühren sich zwei Kupferelemente unterschiedlichen Signals, meldet der \\nDRC diesen Fehler.\\n', metadata={'subject': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 15.1 (Windows)', 'total_pages': 656.0, 'keywords': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240104232118+05'30'\", 'encryption': None, 'trapped': '', 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'source': 'ElektronikUndMechanik_Bernstein.pdf', 'file_path': 'causal_ml_research/LiteratureForEmbedding_EPUseCase/ElektronikUndMechanik_Bernstein.pdf', 'creationDate': \"D:20240104182255+05'30'\", 'title': '', 'page': 245.0, 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'author': ''}),\n",

Example: Two\\ncars starting on a cold day, where each has a probability of starting of\\n0.90. What is the probability that at least one will start?\\n– Probability = P(1) + P(2) −P(1∪2) = 0.90 + 0.90 −(0.90 × 0.90) =\\n(1.80 −.89) =.91\\n●Multiplicative events are composed of dependent events One IC in a\\ncircuit has a probability of working of 0.99; another IC in a circuit has\\na probability of working of 0.90.

The statistical methods can\\nprovide tools to help us gain this knowledge.\\nPatrick O’Connor, Practical Reliability Engineering\\nWhen you can measure what you are speaking about and express\\nit in numbers, you know something about it.\\nBut when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in\\nnumbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind.\\nIt may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in\\nyour thoughts, advanced it to the state of science, whatever the\\nmatter may be.\\nLecture to the Institution of Civil Engineers, 3 May 1883,\\nWilliam Thomson – Lord Kelvin\\nCommon statistical pitfalls include sample-size errors, distribution\\nor model errors, and failure-to-validate-data errors. Using sample sizes\\ntoo small to be statistically significant or valid (and using that data to\\nmake long-term decisions!) is a common error in high-reliability systems\\ndesign due to availability, time, complexity, and cost of hardware and\\ntesting. Distribution or model errors are also frequently seen. Using\\nnormal distributions for non-normal data is often done due to the\\nease of calculations and over-reliance on easy spreadsheet statistics.\\nUsing limited, scrubbed, or unvalidated data is also common. Repeating\\nanalyses and modeling at various intervals are highly recommended\\nas more and more credible data is obtained.

This paper investigates a secure offloading system, where the UAV-mounted IRS assists the offloading procedures between ground users and an access point (AP) acting as an edge cloud. In this system, the users except the intended recipients in the offloading process are considered as potential eavesdroppers. The system aims to achieve the minimum total energy consumption of battery-limited ground user devices under constraints for secure offloading accomplishment and operability of UAV-mounted IRS, which is done by optimizing the transmit power of ground user devices, the trajectory and phase shift matrix of UAV-mounted IRS, and the offloading ratio between local execution and edge computing based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can provide the considerable energy savings compared with local execution and partial optimizations.\\n\\nbase stations (BSs) or relays. This is highly desirable for future 6G ecosystems, such as mmWave and THz communication systems with the high frequencies, where severe pathloss and blockage exist [2], [3]. Depending on the deployment location, various types of IRS configurations are considered, such as terrestrial IRS [4], [5] attached to the walls or the surface of ground automobiles. The terrestrial IRS deployed between transceivers, however, has limitations for achieving the desirable virtual links in the presence of structures such as skyscrapers, lamp posts and billboards. Also, the terrestrial wireless infrastructures including terrestrial IRS are suscep- tible to become aging and damaged by the climate events such as extreme temperature, hurricanes, floods and so on. To this end, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted IRS has been developed, leveraging free mobility and high altitude so as to increase the likelihood of establishing strong line-of- sight (LoS) links between transceivers [7]–[10].\\n\\nIndex Terms—Edge computing, communication, computing, physical-layer security, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), intelli- gent reflecting surface (IRS)\\n\\nI.

In [7], an active self-steering mechanism for UAV- mounted IRS is developed via reinforcement learning (RL) strategy derived from Q-learning to maximize the downlink mmWave communication capacity. The authors in [8] propose the use of UAV-mounted IRS for a full-duplex relaying system to provide an extra degree of freedom and analyze end-to-end outage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency. In [9], the UAV-mounted IRS placement, phase shift and transmit beamforming at BS are jointly optimized via the max–min problem regarding a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within a spe- cific service zone. In contrast to the work in [7]–[9] that focus on utilizing UAV-mounted IRS for enhancing the primary end- to-end communication capacity, the authors in [10] employ the UAV-mounted IRS for secure networks under the existence of eavesdroppers, and propose the joint optimization of UAV- mounted IRS trajectory and passive beamforming to maximize the secure energy efficiency, where the UAV-mounted IRS acts as the relay between BS and ground users.\\n\\nRecently, the IRS has also been studied for secure offloading and communication systems [11]–[13]. By adjusting the beam direction and establishing the good channel quality with the IRS, the security issue and eavesdropping problem caused by the open attributes of the wireless medium can be alleviated. The authors in [11] investigate the secrecy improvement of mobile edge computing (MEC) systems with the aid of IRS for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. [12] also proposes an IRS-assisted secure MEC system to maximize the minimum\\n\\n1\\n\\nSecure offloading\\n\\nUAV-mounted IRSUser k\\n\\nAP(Edge cloud)Internal eavesdroppers\\n\\nFig. 1.

In [13], the use of UAV relay and IRS is considered in order to mitigate the effects of narrow coverage and unfavorable wireless conditions in IoT, gaining the potential in terms of computation enhancement.\\n\\nNevertheless, the preceding works [11]–[13] do not fully take advantage of the properties of the IRS for the secure offloading systems, even though the UAV-mounted IRS can enhance the secrecy rate and computing performance. The tractable three-dimensional path planning of UAV-mounted IRS facilitates the multiple degrees of freedom for edge com- puting performance enhancement. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the energy-efficient secure offloading system with the aid of the UAV-mounted IRS has not been explored thoroughly, and is still in its early stages, motivating our work presented herein.\\n\\nIn this paper, we develop an energy-efficient secure offload- ing system, where the UAV-mounted IRS is deployed to create strong virtual links between ground user devices, such as IoT devices, and an access point (AP) acting as an edge cloud. The existing infrastructure may block the LoS links between user devices and the AP, severely hindering data transfer between the input and output interface in complex offloading environments. Furthermore, especially in the IoT scenario, with a number of user devices controlled by the same AP, user privacy and security issues are constantly increasing. Herein, the users, who are not the intended recipients for offloading, are regarded as potential eavesdroppers. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of battery-limited ground user devices with constraints for secure offloading accomplishment and the operability of the UAV-mounted IRS. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem for the transmit power of ground user devices and AP, the trajectory and phase shift matrix of the UAV-mounted IRS and the offloading ratio between local execution and edge computing, whose solutions are obtained based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method [14]. Via numerical results, it is verified that the proposed algorithm can achieve the considerable energy\\n\\nsavings compared to local execution and partial optimizations. The remaining sections of this paper are outlined as follows. System model and performance metrics are described in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we formulate the optimization problem for the energy-efficient secure offloading system via UAV-mounted IRS, and the proposed algorithm is provided. In addition, we develop the offloading techniques by adopting a more complex aerodynamic model for the flying energy model of the UAV- mounted IRS in Sec. IV. Sec. V shows the numerical results with analyses, and the conclusion are provided in Sec. VI.\\n\\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\\n\\nA. Setup\\n\\nWe consider a secure offloading system that utilizes an UAV-mounted IRS to assist the offloading procedure from K single-antenna ground users to a single-antenna AP acting as edge server as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the lack of LoS links between the AP and the ground users is assumed. The possible examples and applications can be for instance the communication environments with limited infrastructures in disaster response, emergency relief, military scenarios, or crowded cities with high data traffic. Also, the UAV-mounted IRS can be employed as an alternative option in situations, where the aging infrastructure supporting IoT devices, like terrestrial IRS, has been damaged or destroyed by the extreme climate changes. All the ground users and AP require the secure communication to enable offloading across the same frequency band. However, the use of a cochannel inevitably causes data exposure to undesired recipients. Here, we refer to users, who are not the intended recipients, as the internal eavesdroppers. The UAV-mounted IRS is utilized to strengthen the secrecy of an intended point-to-point connection, as the IRS is supposed to be installed at the UAV, enabling the more flexibility to set up a strong LoS between the nodes than terrestrial IRS [1]. For the ease of design complexity, we adopt a uniform linear array1 comprising L reflecting elements at the IRS, each of which is controlled by an embedded development board mounted on the UAV.\\n\\nWe assume that a reliable power supply is available at AP, e.g., via plugging to the power supplier or equipping battery storage with sufficient capacity [15], and the AP does not have any restrictions on the resolution of its digital front-ends. We also suppose that the size of the output bits from the AP is much smaller than the size of the offloading bits required for the operation in each user, which allows us to focus on the energy consumption of uplink transmission utilized in the offloading procedures. For each user k ∈ K = {1, . . . , K}, frequency division duplex (FDD) with an equal division of channel bandwidth is assumed. The input information to be processed is denoted by Ik in bits, and the CPU cycles required per input bit for computation is denoted by Ck in cycles/bits. The mission time is limited to T , during which all user requests have to be processed.\\n\\n1With the minor modifications to the phase shift design, the proposed algorithm in this work can be applied for the uniform planar array of UAV- mounted IRS.\\n\\n2\\n\\nFor the positions of the ground nodes and the UAV-mounted IRS, we use three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates in meters (m). The ground nodes, including the users and AP, are deployed at the planar coordinates pppk = (xk, yk) and pppA = (xA, yA), respectively, in the xy-plane, while the UAV-mounted IRS flies along a horizontal trajectory pppU (t) = (xU (t), yU (t)) with the fixed altitude H for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . The fixed altitude H of UAV-mounted IRS is determined as the altitude that ensures aviation safety, e.g., provision against sudden stall or building collisions [16]. The UAV- mounted IRS is assumed to be designed compactly so that the same positions are considered for both the UAV and IRS. For tractability, we slice the mission time T into Ns time slots uniformly, such that T = Nsts, where ts represents the slot length that is set to be small enough so that the ground nodes perceive the position of the UAV-mounted IRS as a constant within each slot. Consequently, the trajectory of the UAV-mounted IRS pppU (t) at each slot can be discretized as pppU [n] = (xU [n], yU [n]), for n ∈ N = {1, . . . , Ns}, whose horizontal trajectory (xU (t), yU (t)) over T can be roughly represented by the sequence {xU [n], yU [n]}Ns n=1. Furthermore, owing to the operational capability as well as the starting point and final point of the UAV-mounted IRS, the con- straints of the UAV-mounted IRS include its maximum speed as vmax in m/s, and its initial and terminal coordinates as (xI , yI , H) and (xF , yF , H), where pppU [1] = (xI , yI ) and pppU [Ns + 1] = (xF , yF ). Accordingly, the UAV-mounted IRS can fly no further than Dmax = vmaxts within a single time slot. For feasibility, the distance between the initial and terminal coordinates is assumed to satisfy the condition of (cid:112)(xF − xI )2 + (yF − yI )2 ≤ vmaxT . For each slot, the mobility constraint of UAV-mounted IRS is given as\\n\\n||pppU [n + 1] − pppU [n]|| ≤ Dmax,\\n\\nfor n ∈ N .\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nWe define the IRS diagonal phase shift matrix as ΘΘΘ[n] ≜ diag{ejθ1[n], ejθ2[n], . . . , ejθL[n]} ∈ CL×L with the lth phase shift of the subsurface θl[n] ∈ [0, 2π] for l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, where the reflection amplitude of each subsurface is assumed to be one. Here, the finite number Q of discrete levels from 0 to 2π is chosen for the phase-shift of subsurface θl[n] to ease the circuit implementation in practice, and accordingly we have θl ∈ η ≜ {0, ∆θ, . . . , (Q − 1)∆θ}, where ∆θ = 2π/Q. In the offloading process, we consider either air-to-ground (A2G) or ground-to-air (G2A) channels, where the ground nodes include the AP and K ground users. Following [4], [10], the channel gains from ground node i to the UAV-mounted IRS and from the UAV-mounted IRS to ground node i in the time slot n are expressed as\\n\\nhhhiU (pppU [n]) g0d−2 = hhhU i(pppU [n]) g0d−2\\n\\n(cid:113)\\n\\niU [n][1 e−jkwdϕiU [n]\\n\\n(cid:113)\\n\\nU i [n][1 e−jkwdϕU i[n]\\n\\n=\\n\\n· · e−jkwd(L−1)ϕiU [n]]T , (2a)\\n\\n· · e−jkwd(L−1)ϕU i[n]]T , (2b)\\n\\nfor i ∈ K ∪ {A}, respectively, where g0 represents the the reference distance d0 = 1m, channel power gain at which is determined by the antenna gains of the transceiver\\n\\nand the center frequency, d represents the antenna spacing, and kw = 2π/λ is the wavenumber of the carrier de- fined with the wavelength λ. In (2), dU i[n] = diU [n] = (cid:112)(xU [n] − xi)2 + (yU [n] − yi)2 + H 2 is the distance be- tween UAV-mounted IRS and ground node i at the time slot n, and ϕiU [n] = (xU [n] − xi)/dU i[n] and ϕU i[n] = (xi − xU [n])/dU i[n] are the cosine of the angle of arrival (AoA) of the signal from ground node i to UAV-mounted IRS and from UAV-mounted IRS to ground node i, respectively. We assume an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the receiver with zero mean and noise power σ2. For uplink communication, we use hhhkU (pppU [n]) ∈ CL×1 and hhhH U A(pppU [n]) ∈ C1×L to denote the related baseband channels from user k to UAV- mounted IRS and from UAV-mounted IRS to AP, respectively. Therefore, the effective channel from user k to AP is given by\\n\\ngkA(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) ≜ hhhH\\n\\nU A(pppU [n])ΘΘΘ[n]hhhkU (pppU [n]).\\n\\nIn addition, we denote the transmit power of the user k for each slot as πk[n], which is supposed to be bounded by the average and peak power constraints over time owing to their operational capability as\\n\\n1 Ns\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nπk[n] ≤ P avg T ,\\n\\n0 ≤ πk[n] ≤ P max\\n\\nT\\n\\n,\\n\\nfor n ∈ {1, . . . , Ns}.\\n\\nWhen there is no internal eavesdropper, the achievable rate\\n\\nfrom user k to AP at time slot n can be defined as\\n\\nRkA(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])\\n\\n= log2\\n\\n(cid:18)\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nπk[n]||gkA(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2 σ2\\n\\n(cid:19)\\n\\n.\\n\\nIf user j ∈ K for j ̸= k attempts to overhear the uplink communication between user k and AP in time slot n, the achievable rate at user j is written as\\n\\nRkj(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])\\n\\n= log2\\n\\n(cid:18)\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nπk[n]||gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2 σ2\\n\\n(cid:19)\\n\\n,\\n\\nwith gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) ≜ hhhH U j(pppU [n])ΘΘΘ[n]hhhkU (pppU [n]).

Energy Model for Offloading\\n\\n1) Communication Energy Model: In edge computing sys- tems, the communication energy required at K ground users depends on the type of multiple access employed, such as orthogonal or non-orthogonal access (e.g., NOMA in 5G). For system modeling, we focus on orthogonal access, which can be analytically extended to non-orthogonal access by treat- ing undesired interferences as additive noise. In orthogonal access, the uplink communication for each user needs to be performed within ts/K s, which is equally preallocated. Notably, the energy consumption of the UAV-mounted IRS for communication can be assumed to be zero, since the IRS only reflects passively [6]. Furthermore, compared with transmission energy consumption, the energy consumed during reception is negligible, especially for long distances [19]. Consequently, when the kth ground user spends πk[n] at each frame n to offload Ik bits to the AP via UAV-mounted IRS within the mission time T , the communication energy consumption at the n slot can be calculated as for k ∈ K.\\n\\nπk[n]ts K\\n\\nEComm k\\n\\n(πk[n]) =\\n\\n,\\n\\n2) Flying Energy Model: Similar to [20], [21], the flying energy model for UAV-mounted IRS at each frame n can be written as (9)\\n\\nwhere mu is the total mass of the UAV-mounted IRS that includes its payload, and vvvU [n] represents the velocity of the UAV-mounted IRS, and is defined as\\n\\nvvvU [n] =\\n\\n(cid:112)(xU [n + 1] − xU [n])2 + (yU [n + 1] − yU [n])2 ts\\n\\n(10) Here, the flying energy model in (9) relies entirely on the velocity vector vvvU [n], which only accounts for the kinetic energy as the UAV-mounted IRS is assumed to be in level flight with no gravitational potential energy.\\n\\nC. Energy Model for Local Execution\\n\\nContrary to the constrained ground user devices, the AP is supposed to have a sufficient energy budget as an edge server. For reference, we investigate the energy consumption of the local execution case, where all tasks are locally computed at user devices solely. To process Ik bits at each user k within T s, the CPU frequency fk of the kth user has to be set to CkIk/T . The total energy consumption of local execution is then given by\\n\\nELocal k\\n\\n(Ik) ≜ γkCkIk(fk)2 = γk\\n\\nC 3 kI 3 k T 2 ,\\n\\n,where γk represents effective switched capacitance of user k, which is derived as in [22], [23].\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(11)\\n\\n4\\n\\nIII. OPTIMAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF SECURE OFFLOADING SYSTEM\\n\\nIn this paper, our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the battery-limited K ground user devices by jointly optimizing their transmit powers, trajectory and phase shift matrix of UAV-mounted IRS and the offloading ratio between local execution and edge computing under the constraints for uplink secrecy rate as well as for the energy budget and mobility of UAV-mounted IRS. For this purpose, the optimization problem can be formulated as\\n\\nmin πππ,pppU ,vvvU ,ΘΘΘ,ρρρ\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nEComm k\\n\\n(πk[n]) +\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nELocal k\\n\\n(ρkIk) (12a)\\n\\ns.t.\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nBkARUp\\n\\nkA(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) ≥ Ik(1 − ρk),\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nfor k ∈ K,\\n\\n(12b)\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nEF\\n\\nU (vvvU [n]) ≤ Eth,\\n\\nfor n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(12c)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nvvvU [n] =\\n\\n||pppU [n + 1] − pppU [n]|| ts\\n\\n,\\n\\nfor n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(12d)\\n\\npppU [1] = (xI , yI ), pppU [Ns + 1] = (xF , yF ), πk[n] ≥ 0, 0 ≤ ρk ≤ 1, (1) and (4),\\n\\nfor k ∈ K and n ∈ N ,\\n\\nfor k ∈ K,\\n\\n(12e)\\n\\n(12f)\\n\\n(12g)\\n\\n(12h)\\n\\nwhere πππ = {πk[n]}∀k,n, pppU = {pppU [n]}∀n, vvvU = {vvvU [n]}∀n, ΘΘΘ = {ΘΘΘ[n]}∀n and ρρρ = {ρk}∀k, with 0 ≤ ρk ≤ 1 being the offloading ratio between local execution and offloading for the ground user k. For example, ρk = 1 indicates the complete local execution to compute the task entirely at ground user k, while ρk = 0 indicates the complete offloading to execute the task entirely at AP. In (12), BkA is the bandwidth allocated for the uplink communication between the kth ground user and AP, and Eth represents the energy budget of the UAV-mounted IRS within the given mission time. The optimization problem (12) is nonconvex since the uplink secrecy rate constraint (12b) involves coupled term with power control variables πππ, trajectory variables pppU and phase shift matrix ΘΘΘ. To address the constraint (12b), we first introduce the slack variable sss = {sk}∀k, and reformulate (12) as\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nmin πππ,pppU ,vvvU ,ΘΘΘ,ρρρ,sss\\n\\nn=1 s.t. sk ≥ Ik(1 − ρk),\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nEComm k\\n\\n(πk[n]) +\\n\\nfor k ∈ K,\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nELocal k\\n\\n(ρkIk) (13a)\\n\\n(13b)\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nBkA [RkA(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])\\n\\nn=1\\n\\n−Rkj(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])]+ ≥ sk,\\n\\n(12c) - (12h).\\n\\nfor k, j ∈ K and j ̸= k, (13c) (13d)\\n\\nTo handle the non-convexity of (13) due to coupling, we propose an alternative algorithm based on the SCA approach [14], [24] to provide the suboptimal solution of (13). In\\n\\nthe following, alternating method are provided.\\n\\nthe subproblems required for the proposed\\n\\nA. Joint Phase and Trajectory Optimization\\n\\nTo make the problem (13) tractable, we fix the transmit power πππ of the ground users, offloading ratio ρρρ and slack variable sss in (13), which are regarded as deterministic values in the following. For any given πππ, ρρρ, and sss, we can rewrite the problem (13) as\\n\\nFind pppU , ΘΘΘ s.t. (13c), (12c)-(12e), (1).\\n\\n(14a)\\n\\n(14b)\\n\\nIt is noted in (14) that the objective function of (14) does not depend on the trajectory pppU and phase matrix ΘΘΘ of UAV- mounted IRS. Moreover, the problem (14) is still nonconvex owing to the nonconvex constraints (13c). To address this issue, we use a two-step approach, where the trajectory is obtained after optimizing the phase shift matrix.\\n\\n1) Phase Optimization: The phase optimization can be implemented with the several bounds and approximations by using the convex relaxation techniques, which can degrade the optimality performance [10]. Therefore, we adopt a simple but powerful phase design to adjust the phases of the received signal at the AP in the uplink to maximize the received signal strength for the secrecy rate constraint (13c). For any given trajectory pppU , the effective channel gkA(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) for uplink can be expressed as (15)\\n\\n1) Phase Optimization: The phase optimization can be implemented with the several bounds and approximations by using the convex relaxation techniques, which can degrade the optimality performance [10].

By using (15) and (16), we can obtain the effective channel of uplink as\\n\\ngkA(pppU [n]) =\\n\\ng0Lejω U A[n]d2\\n\\n(cid:112)d2\\n\\nkU [n]\\n\\n,\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nwhich depends only on trajectory pppU [n], and yields the achiev- able rate RkA(πk[n], pppU [n]) in (7b) at AP for uplink as\\n\\nˇRkA(πk[n], pppU [n]) ≜ log2\\n\\n(cid:18)\\n\\n1 +\\n\\n0L2 πk[n]g2 U A[n]d2 kU [n]\\n\\nσ2d2\\n\\n(cid:19)\\n\\n.\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nWith the closed-form phase shifts in (16), the effective channel gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) at the internal eavesdropper j for j ̸= k is similarly written as (c.f.

(20)\\n\\n2) Trajectory Optimization: Based on the results (18) and (20), we design the trajectory pppU and the velocity vvvU of UAV- mounted IRS in this section. To handle the nonconvexity of constraint (13c) with respect to pppU , we introduce the slack variables qqq = {qk[n]}∀k,n and rrr = {rkj[n]}∀k,j̸=k,n. Then, the problem (14) can be represented (21a)\\n\\ns.t.\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nBkA\\n\\n(cid:2) ˇRkA(πk[n], qk[n]) − ˇRkj(πk[n], rkj[n])(cid:3)+\\n\\nn=1\\n\\n≥ sk,\\n\\nfor k, j ∈ K, j ̸= k, for k ∈ K and n ∈ N ,\\n\\nd2 U A[n]d2 d2 U j[n]d2\\n\\nkU [n] ≤ qk[n], kU [n] ≥ rkj[n],\\n\\n(21b)\\n\\n(21c)\\n\\nfor k, j ∈ K, j ̸= k and n ∈ N .\\n\\n(21d)\\n\\n(12c)-(12e), (1),\\n\\n(21e)\\n\\nwhere we have defined ˇRkA(πk[n], qk[n])\\n\\n= log2\\n\\n(cid:0)σ2qk[n] + g2\\n\\n0L2πk[n](cid:1) − log2\\n\\n(cid:0)σ2qk[n](cid:1) ,\\n\\n(22a)\\n\\nˇRkj(πk[n], rkj[n])\\n\\n= log2\\n\\n(cid:0)σ2rkj[n] + g2\\n\\n0L2πk[n](cid:1) − log2\\n\\n(cid:0)σ2rkj[n](cid:1) . (22b)\\n\\nThe problem (21) is nonconvex because the constraints (21b) - (21d) have a nonconvex structure, with the difference of concave (DC) structure in (21b) and the coupling constraints in (21c) - (21d). By using the SCA approach, we successively solve the series of convex optimization problems obtained from (21).\\n\\nSpecifically, we first define the set of primal variables for the problem (21) as ΓΓΓ = {ΓΓΓ[n]}∀n with ΓΓΓ[n] = (pppU [n], {qk[n]}∀k, {rkj[n]}∀k,j̸=k,n), and define the ΓΓΓ(z) = {ΓΓΓ(z)[n]}∀n with ΓΓΓ(z)[n] = (ppp(z) kj [n]}∀k,j̸=k,n) ∈ ΩΩΩ for the zth iterate within the feasible set ΩΩΩ of (21). Then, to simplify U = {ppp(z) the notation, we define ppp(z) k [n]} ∀k,n and rrr(z) = {r(z) kj [n]}∀k,j̸=k,n. To tackle the nonconvex constraint with the DC structure, we use the following lemma. Lemma 1: ( [14, Example 3]) For the nonconvex constraint of the form f (xxx) = f +(xxx) − f −(xxx) ≥ 0, where functions f +(xxx) and f −(xxx) are both concave and continuously differ- entiable, we can use the convex lower approximation of f (xxx) under the conditions [14, Assumption 3], which is essential for the SCA technique. Then, we have ¯f (xxx; µµµ) ≜ f +(xxx) − f −(µµµ) − ∇xxxf −(µµµ)T (xxx − µµµ) ≤ f (xxx).

As the objective function of (29) is constant, the solution of problem (29) can be randomly or arbitrarily chosen within the feasible set of (29). Therefore, the trajectory of UAV-mounted IRS can be obtained using Algorithm 1, where the phase of UAV-mounted IRS is designed based on (16).\\n\\nB. Joint Power and Offloading Ratio Optimization\\n\\nIn this section, we optimize the power allocation and offloading ratio of the user by considering the given trajectory pppU , velocity vvvU and phase shift matrix ΘΘΘ as deterministic values.

Update z ← z + 1\\n\\nOutput: ΓΓΓ∗(ΓΓΓ(z)) = πππ∗, ρρρ∗, sss∗.\\n\\nSCA method as described in Sec. III-A. Then, it is essential to define the set of primal variables for the problem (30) as ΓΓΓ = {ΓΓΓ[n]}∀n with ΓΓΓ[n] = ({πk[n]}∀k), and define ΓΓΓ(z) = {ΓΓΓ(z)[n]}∀n with ΓΓΓ(z)[n] = ({π(z) k [n]}∀k) ∈ ΩΩΩ for the zth iterate within the feasible set ΩΩΩ of (30). Also, πππ(z) = {π(z) k [n]}∀k,n is defined to ease the notation. By following Lemma 1, we can regard Rkj(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) in (13c) as the convex term −f −(xxx) with respect to πk[n], for the fixed pppU and ΘΘΘ, which is upper-bounded as\\n\\nRkj(ΓΓΓ[n]) ≜ Rkj(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]) (cid:18)\\n\\n(cid:19)\\n\\nπk[n]||gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2 σ2 π(z) k [n]||gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2 σ2 ||gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2 (cid:16) (cid:16) σ2 + π(z)\\n\\n= log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\n(cid:32)\\n\\n(cid:33)\\n\\n≤ log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\n(cid:17) k [n]\\n\\nπk[n] − π(z)\\n\\n+\\n\\n(cid:17)\\n\\nln 2\\n\\nk [n]||gkj(pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n])||2\\n\\n= ˆRkj(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n], π(z) ≜ ˆRkj(ΓΓΓ[n]; ΓΓΓ(z)[n]).\\n\\nk [n])\\n\\n(31)\\n\\nWith the upper bound in (31), we can reformulate the problem (30) as\\n\\nmin ΓΓΓ\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nπk[n]ts K\\n\\n+\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nγk\\n\\nC 3\\n\\nk(ρkIk)3 T 2\\n\\n(32a)\\n\\ns.t.\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nBkA\\n\\n(cid:104)\\n\\nRkA(ΓΓΓ[n]) − ˆRkj(ΓΓΓ[n]; ΓΓΓ(z)[n])\\n\\n(cid:105)+\\n\\n≥ sk,\\n\\nn=1\\n\\n(13b), (12f), (12g), (4),\\n\\nfor k, j ∈ K and j ̸= k, (32b) (32c)\\n\\nwhere RkA(ΓΓΓ[n]) ≜ RkA(πk[n], pppU [n], ΘΘΘ[n]). Here, the prob- lem (32) is convex, and thus has a unique solution ΓΓΓ∗(ΓΓΓ(z)) with ΓΓΓ(z) = {ΓΓΓ(z)[n]}∀n, which can be numerically obtained by standard convex optimization strategies or by toolboxes such as CVX MOSEK. Using the approximated problem (32) and SCA approach, we develop Algorithm 2 to achieve the iterative suboptimal solution of problem (30). Based on the discussions in Sec. III-A and Sec. III-B, Algorithm 3 summarizes the proposed algorithm to obtain the solution to the problem (12). The fact that the total energy consumption of ground user devices is nonincreasing in every iteration ensures the convergence of Algorithm 3. Specifically, Algorithm 3 comprises Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, and their convergence is verified through [14, Th. 2] when the sequence of the step size {α(z)} in both algorithms is chosen as α(z) ∈\\n\\n7\\n\\nAlgorithm 3 Proposed algorithm for energy-efficient secure offloading System designed via UAV-mounted IRS\\n\\nInitialize: ΓΓΓ(0) = (ppp(0) sss, ρρρ.

In other words, {α(z)} is a bounded sequence, and any of its limit points that are within ΓΓΓ(∞) corresponds to stationary points for problems (29) and (32). Moreover, the non-existence of the local minimum for the original problem (13) occurs if Algorithm 3 continues indefinitely, as there is no limit point ΓΓΓ(∞) in (29) and (32).\\n\\nIV. PROPULSION ENERGY MODEL OF UAV-MOUNTED IRS\\n\\nIn Sec. II-B2, we consider the flying energy model of UAV- mounted IRS in (9), which relies only on the velocity of UAV- mounted IRS. Here, we follow the more elaborate aerodynamic model for flying energy consumption [20], [25], [26], based on which we develop the energy-efficient secure offloading techniques for the better understanding about the effect of the flying energy model on the system design.\\n\\nFirst, we define the acceleration of UAV-mounted IRS as aaaU [n] = (vvvU [n + 1] −vvvU [n])/ts. Since the velocity vvvU [n] and acceleration aaaU [n] are dependent on the positions of UAV- mounted IRS {pppU [n]}∀n, we can express their relation based on the quadratic Taylor approximation model as follows:\\n\\npppU [n + 1] = pppU [n] + vvvU [n]ts +\\n\\n1 2\\n\\naaaU [n]t2 s.\\n\\n(33)\\n\\nBy following [20], [25], [26], the flying energy model for UAV-mounted IRS at each slot n can be then modeled as follows:\\n\\nU (vvvU [n], aaaU [n]) = κ1 ∥vvvU [n]∥3 (cid:32)\\n\\nEF\\n\\nκ2 ∥vvvU [n]∥\\n\\n+\\n\\n1 +\\n\\n∥aaaU [n]∥2 g2\\n\\n(cid:33)\\n\\n, (34)\\n\\nwhere g indicates gravitational acceleration, and the constants κ1 and κ2 represent the UAV operational capability such as drag coefficient, the area of main rotor disk, and induced power factor, the details of which can be found in [20, Appendix C]. Accordingly, considering (34) in lieu of (9) in (13), the optimization problem (13) can be reformulated as\\n\\nmin πππ,pppU ,vvvU , aaaU ,ΘΘΘ,ρρρ,sss Ns(cid:88)\\n\\ns.t.\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nNs(cid:88)\\n\\nEComm k\\n\\n(πk[n]) +\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nEF\\n\\nU (vvvU [n], aaaU [n]) ≤ Eth,\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nELocal k\\n\\n(ρkIk)\\n\\n(35a)\\n\\n(35b)\\n\\nn=1 vvvU [n + 1] = vvvU [n] + aaaU [n]ts,\\n\\nfor n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(35c)\\n\\nvvvU [1] = vvvU [Ns + 1] = vvvU , aaaU [n] ≤ aaamax for n ∈ N , U , (33), (13b), (13c), (12e) - (12h),\\n\\n(35d)\\n\\n(35e)\\n\\n(35f)\\n\\nwhere aaaU = {aaaU [n]}∀n, (35d) is the constraint about the initial and terminal UAV-mounted IRS velocity, and (35e) is the constraint for the maximum acceleration of UAV-mounted IRS. Compared to (13), the additional optimization variables aaaU are considered in (35) by adopting the new flying energy model (34) of UAV-mounted IRS, which yields the modified or additional constraints (35b) - (35e) and (33). Among them, the modified constraint (35b) is the only nonconvex constraint, while the other newly-added constraints are convex. To address the nonconvexity of (35b), we introduce the slack variable νn, while satisfying the condition 0 ≤ νn ≤ ∥vvvU [n]∥ for all n.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\\n\\nIn this section, we verify the performance of the proposed algorithm by jointly optimizing the transmit power of users, offloading ratio, phase shift matrix and path planning of UAV- mounted IRS via several numerical results. We adopt the flying models given in Sections III and IV, where the flying energy model is developed by (9) (Model 1) or (34) (Model 2). For highlighting the superiority of the proposed algorithm, we compare the following reference schemes: (i) No trajectory optimization and identity phase (No traj.opt. & identity phase): In this scheme, we assume that the phase shift introduced by the passive elements can be represented as a identity matrix, which implies that the phase relation between users and the AP during the uplink communication remains invariant. (ii) No trajectory optimization and fixed phase (No traj.opt. & fixed phase): In this scheme, the phase shift of the passive reflecting elements is fixed with the certain directions, which is established by dividing the mission area into several sections by connecting the AP and the midpoints of two adjacent users,\\n\\n8\\n\\nUE4 (3Mb)\\n\\nUE2 (5Mb)\\n\\nUE1 (1Mb)\\n\\n0102030405060708090100Slot n\\n\\nUE3 (7Mb)\\n\\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7Total energy consumption (J)\\n\\n160170180190200\\n\\nNo traj.opt. & identity phase\\n\\n101102Total energy consumption (J)\\n\\nProposed alg.

(iii) No trajectory optimization and optimal phase (No traj. opt. & opt. phase): With this scheme, the UAV-mounted IRS with the optimized phase flies along the fixed trajectory for the users, whose transmit power and offloading ratio are optimized by the proposed algorithm. Unless specified otherwise, the parameters detailed in Table I are used in simulations. The initial and terminal velocities of the UAV-mounted IRS are set to vvvU = ∥vvvU ∥(pppU [Ns + 1] −pppU [1])/∥pppU [Ns + 1] −pppU [1]∥, where ∥vvvU ∥ ≤ vmax, and κ1 and κ2 are calculated by considering the fixed-wing UAV-mounted IRS according to [20] for Model 2.\\n\\ncient mission time of 160 s, the UAV-mounted IRS travels to be closer to each user to avoid internal eavesdropping of other users. This tendency decreases the total energy consumption of ground user devices as the mission time is increased (see, Fig. 4). Although the above observations are attained under both flying energy Models, Model 2 tends to achieve the smoother trajectory compared to Model 1 owing to the energy consumption defined in terms of accelerations. In Model 1 of Fig. 2 with T = 100 s, the optimized power allocation of ground users is depicted in Fig. 3. It is observed that the higher power and the more time slots are allocated to the users with more bits to be processed. Moreover, the power allocation of each user is concentrated especially when the UAV-mounted IRS is nearby to guarantee the secrecy rate constraint. This aspect can be seen regardless of the type of flying energy model and mission time (not reported here).\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, we consider 240 m × 240 m square area with K = 4 users in each corner of the square as ppp1 = (−120, 120, 0), ppp2 = (120, 120, 0), ppp3 = (120, −120, 0) and ppp4 = (−120, −120, 0) respectively, and AP at the center as pppA = (0, 0, 0), while the initial and terminal coordinates of UAV-mounted IRS are pppU [1] = pppU [Ns + 1] = (−120, 0) with initial speed ∥vvvU ∥ = 7.54 m/s for Model 2. The number of bits required to be processed by each ground user is set to be I1 = 1 Mbits, I2 = 5 Mbits, I3 = 7 Mbits, and I3 = 3 Mbits, respectively, and the number of passive reflecting elements is fixed as L = 16. We investigated the trajectories under different mission times T = 100 s and T = 160 s, in both flying models with fixed altitude H = 90 m.\\n\\nIn Fig. 4, we analyze the total energy consumption of ground user devices of the proposed algorithm as a function of the mission time T . We execute the experiment in the 180×180 m2 square area with K = 4 UEs, each with the same input bits as 5 Mbits, deployed on the edges and the AP in the center. We set the initial and terminal coordinates of UAV- mounted IRS as pppU [1] = pppU [Ns + 1] = (−90, 0), and Table I covers the rest of the parameters that are not mentioned. As seen in Fig. 4, the proposed algorithm of jointly optimizing user transmit power, offloading ratio, UAV-mounted IRS phase shift and trajectory achieves the considerable gains in terms of total energy consumption. Although there is no substantial difference between the UAV-mounted IRS flying energy Model 1 (5.51 J at T = 180 s) and Model 2 (5.68 J at T = 180 s) with the proposed scheme, it is clear that using Model 1 induces the less total energy consumption of ground users than Model\\n\\nIn Fig. 2, the optimized trajectories are illustrated with dif- ferent mission times according to both flying energy models. Under both models, we observe that the UAV-mounted IRS stays longer in the region between each user and the AP. Moreover, it is shown in Fig. 2 that the more bits the user offloads, the longer the UAV-mounted IRS tends to stay for fulfilling the secure offloading requirements. Within the suffi-\\n\\nFig. 5. Total energy consumption of ground users versus the number of reflecting elements L in the same setting of Fig. 4 with Model 1.\\n\\n2. This is because the rotary wing model is more flexible than the propulsion wing-based model in positioning to the optimal position. Notably, the use of fixed phase with the predefined directions attains the 17.03% decrease compared to the identity phase, while the optimal phase offers the 89.23% reduction in the total energy consumption compared to the identity phase, indicating the important role of the phase shift ability of the UAV-mounted IRS as a key performance determinant.\\n\\nFig. 5 illustrates the total energy consumption of ground users versus the number of UAV-mounted IRS reflecting ele- ments L under the same scenario of Fig. 4, with Model 1. With the increasing number of reflecting elements, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is more emphasized in the total energy consumption of ground users. For instance, when the mission time is T = 100 s, the energy consumption with L = 128 is 0.09J, which is only 1.5% of the energy consumed with L = 16. This can be explained that the passive reflecting architecture of UAV-mounted IRS can allow to provide the ad- ditional spatial multiplexing gain without the specific energy. Furthermore, as the number of reflecting elements increases, the difference in energy consumption between mission times of 100 s and 160 s decreases, indicating that the increase in reflecting elements resulted in the smaller gap in the energy consumption of users between different mission times.\\n\\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nIn this paper, we have investigated an energy-efficient secure offloading system with the assistance of UAV-mounted IRS. To this end, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption of ground users by jointly optimizing their transmit power and offloading ratio as well as the trajectory and phase shift of UAV-mounted IRS. We have considered the constraints for secure offloading accomplishment and the energy budget and\\n\\nmobility of UAV-mounted IRS based on different flying energy models. We have proposed algorithm based on SCA method, whose superiority is verified via simulations. Our numerical results have shown the considerable energy savings achieved by our proposed algorithm compared to local execution and partial optimizations, highlighting the importance of the phase shift design and path planning of the UAV-mounted IRS in achieving energy-efficient secure offloading. As our future works, the multiple UAV-mounted IRSs with the different height and the terrestrial IRSs can be explored for secure offloading system.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n[1] Q. Wu, J. Xu, Y. Zong, D.

However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfig- urable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode- and-forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network’s minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteris- tics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.\\n\\nIndex Terms—unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), full-duplex relay, trajectory optimiza- tion, energy efficiency\\n\\nD.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as transfor- mative tools in the landscape of future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks [1], [2]. Specifically, their inherent flexibil- ity allows them to follow optimized trajectories, dynamically adjusting their paths to offer line-of-sight (LoS) channels ubiq- uitously. This capability makes them invaluable in scenarios demanding adaptive connectivity solutions, such as bridging connectivity gaps in challenging terrains or enhancing net- work resilience in disaster-stricken areas [1], [3]. Furthermore, their ability to provide on-demand high-capacity coverage in crowded events or remote locations underscores their pivotal role in reshaping wireless communication. However, despite their numerous advantages, UAVs face the challenge of limited onboard energy that dictates their operational time [4], [5], underscoring the need to optimize their operational efficiency. To this end, innovative methods are essential to harness the full potential of UAVs, while taking into account their energy constraints.\\n\\nGiven the finite flight duration of UAVs, it becomes of paramount importance to maximize data throughput and ef- ficiency during their operational time. In this direction, full- duplex (FD) communication, with its ability to simultaneously transmit and receive data, emerges as a key solution in this context [6]. Unlike traditional half-duplex systems that alternate between transmission and reception, FD systems effectively double the spectral efficiency, making every time slot of the UAV’s flight time count [6], [7]. This capability is particularly beneficial for UAVs, which can dynamically adjust their positions to establish LoS communication links, without the constraints of ground-based systems. To realize the potential of FD communications in UAVs, the two promising technologies that come to the forefront are reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs) [8], [9]. Specifically, an RIS is an advanced technology that can be implemented as either a programmable reflectarray or a programmable metasurface, both designed to manipulate elec- tromagnetic (EM) waves for enhanced communication. Specif- ically, programmable reflectarrays offer dynamic backscatter- ing and phase shifting of incident waveforms through omni- directional antennas with controllable termination, while pro- grammable metasurfaces extend these capabilities to include anomalous reflection angles and polarization manipulation [?]. This capability allows RIS to support FD communications\\n\\nThe work has been funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programs under grant agreement No 101021659 (SENTINEL).\\n\\n1\\n\\nby dynamically adjusting signal paths with minimal power requirements, significantly improving connectivity and signal quality [10]–[12]. On the other hand, FDRs enhance spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and recep- tion of signals over the same frequency channel, using distinct sets of antennas for each task [7], [13]. In addition, unlike RISs, the operation of FDRs is also based on the decode- and-forward (DF) protocol, which involves the decoding of the received message before forwarding, ensuring transmis- sion of only accurately decoded messages. Therefore, as the integration of these technologies with UAVs continues to evolve, understanding their distinct advantages and challenges becomes crucial in shaping the future of UAV-assisted wireless networks.\\n\\nA. Related Works\\n\\nIn recent years, the integration of UAVs with RIS and FDRs has gathered significant attention in the research community. Specifically, numerous studies have delved into the intricacies of UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDRs, exploring various aspects ranging from performance optimization to energy efficiency, and underscoring their potential to reshape the dynamics of wireless communication.\\n\\n1) UAV-mounted RIS: As researchers explore ways to opti- mize wireless communications, the integration of UAVs with RISs emerges as a promising solution to maintain LoS links, especially in propagation environments where the wireless links can often be obstructed [14]. Specifically, the authors in [15] showcased that UAV-mounted RIS can improve outage performance in dense urban scenarios, even with the dynamic mobility of UAVs. Additionally, [16] explored strategies for the optimal deployment of UAV-mounted RIS in URLLC systems, focusing on scenarios where user fairness is of paramount importance, while [17] proposed a novel system design that leverages ambient backscatter communication in UAV-mounted RIS networks. Interestingly, considering the dif- ferent electromagnetic functionalities of RIS [10], the authors in [18] provided a rigorous path loss model for the case where a UAV-mounted absorbing metasurface is utilized and validated the findings experimentally in an anechoic chamber. Transitioning to trajectory design, [19] emphasized on three- dimensional (3D) trajectory design for UAVs in urban envi- ronments, aiming to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for ground users, while [20] presented a trajectory optimization framework for UAV-mounted RIS focusing on maximizing the network’s secure energy efficiency. Finally, [21] examined the joint optimization of the UAV trajectory design and the RIS design to facilitate the offloading of computational tasks in IoT networks. To this end, it is imperative to consider both communication and trajectory design for realizing the full potential of UAV-mounted RIS in diverse wireless network scenarios.\\n\\n2) UAV-mounted FDR: While UAV-mounted RISs offer unique advantages in wireless communications, they are often challenged by significant path loss due to the double path loss phenomenon [11]. In contrast, UAV-mounted FDRs, equipped with integrated electronic components such as amplifiers and\\n\\ndecoders, not only have the capability to transmit and receive signals simultaneously but can also process the received signal, making them more robust to path loss than RISs. Therefore, UAV-mounted FDRs present a compelling solution, especially in dynamic environments demanding real-time data exchange and reduced latency [7], [9]. By taking into account the advantages of FDRs, [22] delved into optimizing the source and the UAV-mounted FDR transmit power along with its trajectory to enhance the system’s outage probability. Further- more, the potential of UAV-mounted FDRs in high-frequency scenarios was highlighted by [23] and [24], with a focus on millimeter-wave channels. Moreover, considering the increas- ing importance of secure communications, [25] introduced a secrecy communication scheme using a UAV-mounted FDR, optimizing various parameters to ensure both energy efficiency and security. Lastly, [26], and [27] proposed an optimization algorithm for the UAV trajectory, user scheduling, and FDR power, showcasing significant performance improvements in scenarios with multiple ground users. Therefore, these recent research advances underscore the versatility of UAV-mounted FDRs in addressing diverse communication challenges in modern wireless networks.\\n\\nB. Motivation & Contribution\\n\\nIn light of the aforementioned works, both RIS and FDR have been extensively compared to determine their respective advantages. However, a critical oversight concerning compre- hensive energy consumption models in the analysis of UAV- mounted systems remains prevalent in the existing literature. For instance, while nearly passive, an RIS can become consid- erably larger due to the numerous reflecting elements, adding weight and impacting the UAV’s energy efficiency [28]. Con- versely, an FDR, though lightweight, demands more energy for tasks like decoding, amplification, and self-interference (SI) mitigation [24], [29]. Additionally, the different path loss characteristics of these systems introduce uncertainty in the UAV energy consumption for traversing, as the UAV may need to navigate to various locations to optimize path loss, further complicating the UAV energy consumption. To this end, neglecting detailed energy consumption models in trajectory optimization may lead to incomplete or imprecise assessments of the operational capabilities and limitations of UAV-mounted RIS and FDR systems. Building on this, few studies have focused on the performance of UAV-mounted systems, while considering their energy consumption profiles. For instance, [28] and [30] explored UAV-mounted RIS-based communications, emphasizing the RIS weight in UAV energy consumption and identifying an optimal number of reflecting elements, with the latter adjusting this number with the addi- tion of a solar panel. Finally, even though [31] compared UAV- mounted RIS with their relay counterparts, it overlooked the energy consumption characteristics and trajectory planning, thus potentially leading to incomplete conclusions. Therefore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no existing work provides a comprehensive comparison of UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDRs, especially in the context of opti- mal trajectory design, while considering their distinct energy consumption profiles.\\n\\n2\\n\\nIn this paper, a comprehensive analysis of both UAV- mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDR employing the DF protocol is presented. In more detail, our contribution is the following:\\n\\nWe devise appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDR that accurately capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, flight duration, and the operational needs of RISs and FDRs in terms of energy.\\n\\nRecognizing the intricacies of UAV-mounted RIS and FDR setups, we formulate a joint time division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling and UAV trajectory op- timization problem that accounts for the power dynamics associated with both technologies. Given the non-convex nature of this optimization problem, we employ a com- bination of alternate optimization and successive convex optimization techniques, ensuring an efficient approach to obtaining an approximate optimal solution.\\n\\nThrough simulation results, we demonstrate how our proposed methods significantly enhance the network min- imum rate and user fairness. More specifically, our results show that for UAV-mounted RIS, increasing the number of reflecting elements does not necessarily translate into improved performance, largely due to the added weight of a larger RIS that limits operational flight time. In a no- table shift from existing assumptions, the UAV-mounted FDR consistently outperforms the nearly passive RIS, which underscores the key role of UAV motors and the associated weight in overall UAV energy consumption. Additionally, the crucial role of the UAV’s battery capacity in trajectory optimization, directly influencing the optimal trajectory and thereby necessitating UAV movement only when it is essential for minimizing energy consumption during traversal. To this end, our work emphasizes the importance of energy- aware design in UAV-assisted communication networks, focusing on balancing energy consumption with commu- nication efficiency. the results highlight\\n\\nC. Structure\\n\\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. The system model is described in Section II. Furthermore, the examined optimization problem and its solution is presented in Section III, while our simulation results are presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.\\n\\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\\n\\nA. System Overview\\n\\nWe examine a network of K ground nodes (GNs) that are randomly distributed over a rectangular region with sides equal to L, and a base station (BS), which also operates as a UAV charging station (CS). However, given the challenging propagation conditions due to excessive distances, physical obstructions like buildings, and the GNs’ limited transmission power, it is assumed that direct communication links between each GN and the BS are not available. To address this, we employ a rotary-wing UAV equipped with either an RIS or\\n\\nFig. 1: UAV-assisted network topology.\\n\\nan FDR, to act as an intermediate assisting node between the GNs and the BS. Specifically, the UAV takes off from the BS and establishes LoS communication between the GNs and the BS, while flying along a designated trajectory. Afterwards, the UAV returns to the BS for recharging purposes, leveraging the BS’s dual functionality as a CS [32]. It should be highlighted that the examined network employs TDMA, a channel access time slots to multiple users method that allocates distinct within the same frequency band. This approach allows multi- ple GNs to share the same communication channel without interference, ensuring efficient service to different ground nodes within the UAV’s flight duration. Finally, as illustrated in Fig. 1, it is crucial to ensure that the communication equipment is appropriately attached to the UAV frame to avoid disrupting the airflow around the motors and, thus, compromising its aerodynamics and stability [30].\\n\\nConsidering a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, we assume that the rectangular region’s center coincides with the ori- gin of the coordinate system, the BS location is equal to lBS = [0, 0, HBS], where HBS represents the BS height, and the K GNs are located at lk = [xk, yk, 0], where k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, respectively. Additionally, we assume that the UAV flies at a fixed altitude Hu, which is selected appropriately to ensure that the UAV navigates clear of any the environmental obstacles. Furthermore, considering that trajectory duration equals to T , the UAV location at time t can be written as q(t) = [xq(t), yq(t), Hu], where 0 ≤ t ≤ T and (xq(t), yq(t)) denote the x-y UAV coordinate at time t. However, for tractability reasons, the flight duration T is divided into N equal time slots, i.e., T = N δt, where δt is the duration of each time slot. Hence, the UAV trajectory q(t) during T can be efficiently approximated by a N -length sequence q[n] = [xq[n], yq[n], Hu], n ∈ N , N = {1, . . . , N }, where (cid:0)xq[n], yq[n] (cid:1) denote the x-y UAV coordinate at n-th time slot. Moreover, to derive the total number of time slots N associated with the UAV trajectory, it is essential to consider both the battery capacity of the available UAV battery and its overall power consumption. Specifically, given a UAV with a battery capacity Bc and an average power consumption per time slot of ˜Pd, the flight duration in time slots can be formulated as õ Bc ˜Pd\\n\\nû\\n\\nN =\\n\\n,\\n\\n3\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere ⌊·⌋ is the floor function, and d ∈ {RIS, FD} describes the communication equipment mounted on the UAV (i.e., RIS or FDR).\\n\\nB. System’s Achievable Rate\\n\\nIn order to deduce which is the most appropriate commu- nication technology between RISs or FDRs to be mounted on a UAV, a thorough evaluation of the network performance is imperative. Therefore, below, we express the achievable rate of a network when the GN-BS communication is facilitated by either a UAV-mounted RIS or a UAV-mounted FDR.\\n\\n1) UAV-mounted RIS: Over the last years, RISs have emerged as efficient tools for manipulating EM waves with minimal energy consumption. Therefore, the integration of RISs on UAVs can offer a dynamic approach to wireless networks, as a UAV can optimally position an RIS to steer incoming EM waves directly to the BS, ensuring flexible 3D network coverage. Hence, considering a reflectarray-based RIS that performs perfect beam-steering [11], the achievable rate of the k-th GN in a UAV-mounted RIS-assisted TDMA network during the n-th time slot is expressed as (2)\\n\\nwhere B is the system’s bandwidth and ak[n] is a binary variable that represents the time slot allocation in the TDMA network. Specifically, when ak[n] = 1, it signifies that com- munication is established between the k-th GN and the BS at the n-th time slot. Moreover, ℓRIS[n] is the path loss that corresponds to the GN-RIS and RIS-BS links, respectively, which can be modeled through the double path loss model as\\n\\nnp (cid:1)np ×\\n\\nnp (cid:1)np ,\\n\\nC0d0 (cid:0)d1[n]\\n\\nC0d0 (cid:0)d2[n] (cid:1)2\\n\\nℓRIS[n] = ℓ1[n]ℓ2[n] =\\n\\nwhere np is the path-loss exponent, C0 = (cid:0) λ is the path loss of GN-UAV and UAV-BS links at the reference distance d0 with λ denoting the wavelength, while d1[n] and d2[n] express the distances of the GN-UAV and the UAV-BS links at the n-th time slot, respectively, and are equal to\\n\\n4π\\n\\nd1[n] = ∥q[n] − lk[n]∥,\\n\\nand\\n\\nd2[n] = ∥lBS[n] − q[n]∥,\\n\\nwith ∥ · ∥ being the Euclidean norm. Moreover, M denotes the number of the RIS reflecting elements, γt[n] = Pt[n] is the σ2 transmit SNR at the n-th time slot, with Pt[n] referring to the GN transmit power at the n-th time slot and σ2 referring to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) affecting the BS, and G = GtGr is the product of the GN and BS antenna gains. Finally, considering the LoS nature of air-to-ground communication links, the path loss exponent np is equal to 2. Consequently, the system’s achievable rate is equal to ì â\\n\\nRRIS,k[n] = Bak[n]log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\n2d0 (cid:0)d1[n]d2[n] (cid:123)(cid:122) γRIS r,k[n]\\n\\nγt[n]GC0\\n\\n(cid:124)\\n\\n4M 2 (cid:1)2\\n\\n(cid:125)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n, (6)\\n\\n4\\n\\nwhere γRIS r,k[n] is the SNR at the receiver side for the UAV- mounted RIS case when the k-th GN is served. It should in this work, we assume that all K be mentioned that, GNs transmit with the same constant low power within the trajectory duration, thus Pt[n] = Pt and γt[n] = γt.\\n\\n2) UAV-mounted FDR: An alternative solution that has been proposed for air-to-ground networking with improved spectral efficiency is to mount an FDR upon the UAV, referred to as UAV-mounted FDR [26]. Specifically, a UAV-mounted FDR with An = Ar + At antennas can provide improved spectral efficiency as it is able to utilize simultaneously Ar antennas for reception and At antennas for transmission within one time slot, in contrast to conventional half-duplex relays, which utilize all of their antennas for distinct reception or transmission. However, it is imperative to note that in contrast to RISs, FDRs are inherently susceptible to SI, indicating the importance of advanced SI suppression techniques to optimize their operation. Nevertheless, the process of both analog and digital SI mitigation strategies has positioned FD relays for greater prominence in future network architectures [26]. To this end, assuming that the UAV-mounted FDR employs the DF protocol and that Ar antennas perform maximum ratio combining (MRC) and At antennas perform maximum ratio transmission (MRT) [33], the achievable rate of the k-th GN within the n-th time slot can be expressed as where RFD,1[n] denotes the achievable rate from the k-th GN to the UAV-mounted FDR at the n-th time slot, and RFD,2[n] denotes the achievable rate from the UAV-mounted FDR to the BS at the n-th time slot, and can be described as å Ç\\n\\nRFD,1[n] = Bak[n] log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nPtℓ1[n]GtAr AtGrPu[n]ω + σ1\\n\\n2\\n\\n,\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nand\\n\\nRFD,2[n] = Bak[n] log2\\n\\nÅ\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nAtGrPu[n]ℓ2[n] σ2 2\\n\\nã\\n\\n,\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nwhere Pu[n] is the FDR transmit power at the n-th time slot, 2 = σ2 denote the variance of the AWGN affecting 1 = σ2 σ2 the FDR and the BS, respectively, and ω ∈ [0, 1] is the self- interference cancellation (SIC) coefficient. Finally, recalling the favorable characteristics of air-to-ground communication links, i.e., np = 2, then RFD,1[n] and RFD,2[n] can be rewritten as\\n\\nà\\n\\ní\\n\\nRFD,1[n] = Bak[n] log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nd1[n] (cid:124)\\n\\n2GtAr PtC0d0 2 (cid:0)AtGrPu[n]ω + σ2(cid:1) (cid:125)\\n\\n(cid:123)(cid:122) γ1[n]\\n\\n,\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nand\\n\\nà\\n\\ní\\n\\nRFD,2[n] = Bak[n] log2\\n\\n1 +\\n\\nAtGrPu[n]C0d0 d2[n] (cid:123)(cid:122) γ2[n]\\n\\n2σ2\\n\\n(cid:124)\\n\\n2\\n\\n(cid:125)\\n\\n.

UAV Power Consumption\\n\\nGiven the inherent battery constraints of UAVs that result in finite flight duration, to understand their power dynamics, particularly when integrating various the UAV power communication technologies. Specifically, consumption with varied communication equipment can be described as\\n\\nit becomes crucial\\n\\nPd[n] = Pth,d[n] + Pc,d + Ptr,\\n\\nwhere Pth,d[n] refers to UAV thrusting and encompasses the power demands for transitioning, countering wind drag, and related activities. Furthermore, Pc,d denotes the power required by the communication equipment (e.g., RIS or FDR), while Ptr is a minimal constant power associated with the UAV’s navigational communication (typically less than 1 W), and can be considered negligible [28]. To elaborate further on the required power for the consumption model, the required power for the reflectarray-based RIS operation Pc,RIS can be described as\\n\\nPc,RIS = M Pe + Pct,\\n\\nwhere Pe represents the power consumption of each reflecting element, and Pct refers to the energy required by the RIS controller to periodically adjust the RIS phase shift profile within every time slot. Furthermore, the power consumption for the FDR operation Pc,FD is given as\\n\\nPc,FD = Pu∗[n] (1 + α) + AnP C R ,\\n\\nwhere Pu is the FDR transmission power, α is the inverse of the power amplifier drain efficiency, and P C R denotes the power consumption of an An-antenna transceiver [34]. This transceiver consumption encompasses the mixer power, the power of phase shifters for each antenna during transmission and reception, the power of each low-noise amplifier per antenna, the frequency synthesizer power, and the encoder power consumption.\\n\\nConsidering the inherent dynamics of UAVs, the thrusting power Pth,d plays a pivotal role in the total power consump- tion. Notably, Pth,d varies within each time slot, being heavily influenced by the UAV speed, its weight, aerodynamic design, and other onboard components such as the battery weight. Thus, regarding the consumption model presented in [28], Pth,d[n] can be reliably characterized as\\n\\nPth,d[n] = C1Wd[n]\\n\\n2 + C2Wd[n] + C3,\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n(13)\\n\\n(14)\\n\\n(15)\\n\\n(16)\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nwhere C1, C2, and C3 are motor-dependent parameters, while Wd[n] encompasses all weight components impacting thrusting power, which can be expressed as\\n\\nWd[n] = Uw + Dw + Rw,d + Sw,d[n].\\n\\nIn more detail, Uw expresses the weight of the UAV frame and its battery, while Dw describes the wind drag given as\\n\\nDw =\\n\\nρav2\\n\\naCdAUAV\\n\\n2g\\n\\n,\\n\\nwhere ρa is the air density, g is the gravity acceleration, va is the average wind velocity, Cd is the drag shape coefficient given experimentally, and AUAV is UAV frame area. Moreover, Rw,d is the communication equipment weight, where in the RIS case is given by Rw,RIS = M Ew, while for an FDR with An antennas is equal to Rw,DF = AnAw, where Ew is the weight of one reflecting element and Aw is the weight of each FDR antenna, respectively. Finally, Sw,d[n] is the extra weight added to the motors due to any change in the speed of the UAV in each time slot given by\\n\\nSw,d[n] = (Tmax − Uw − Dw − Rw,d)\\n\\nυ[n] υmax\\n\\n,\\n\\nwith Tmax being the maximum achievable thrust, υ[n] = ∥q[n]−q[n−1]∥ reflecting the average UAV speed within the n-th δt time slot, and vmax expressing the maximum achievable UAV speed. It should be mentioned that the choice of UAV motors is directly influenced by the weight they are required to lift. As such, a UAV-mounted RIS, which is generally heavier, would demand different motors than a UAV-mounted FDR, to stay in the air for the same amount of time slots as the UAV-mounted FDR. Finally, considering (1) and the available Bc, by setting υ[n] = 0 or υ[n] = υmax in (20), we can obtain the maximum and the minimum flight duration in terms of time slots, i.e., Nmax, Nmin.\\n\\nIII. ENERGY-AWARE TRAJECTORY DESIGN\\n\\nIn this section, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to derive a UAV trajectory that maximizes the mini- mum data rate across K GNs, ensuring GN fairness across the network. Unlike existing works, our approach underscores the importance of energy awareness, especially given the inherent battery constraints of UAVs. Specifically, our optimization problem intrinsically incorporates the UAV’s power consump- tion, which is influenced by the mounted communication device, as well as the UAV velocity. Considering these energy dynamics, the formulated optimization problem not only en- sures the practical relevance of our findings, but also provides design insights into the characteristics of the employed RIS and FDR that optimize network performance. Moreover, the optimization guarantees that the power consumed by the UAV during its trajectory does not surpass its available battery en- ergy, ensuring the UAV’s safe return to the BS and highlighting the significance of energy-aware trajectory design. To this end, we will examine the network efficiency in terms of achievable rate and fairness for both RIS and FDR.\\n\\n5\\n\\n(18)\\n\\n(19)\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nA. Problem Formulation\\n\\nTo efficiently maximize the minimum data rate of the network, we aim to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory and TDMA user scheduling, taking into account mobility, user scheduling, and UAV power consumption constraints. Given these considerations, by leveraging the integer variable A that represents the TDMA scheduling, and the continuous variable Q that describes the UAV trajectory, the optimization problem for both UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDR cases can be formulated as\\n\\nmax A,Q\\n\\nmin k\\n\\n(cid:40) N (cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nRd,k[n]\\n\\n(cid:41)\\n\\ns.t C1 : q[1] = q[N ],\\n\\nC2 : υ[n] ≤ υmax, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\nC3 :\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nak[n] ≤ 1, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(P1)\\n\\nC4 : Bc − δt\\n\\nN (cid:88)\\n\\nPd[n] ≥ 0,\\n\\nn=1 C5 : ak[n] ∈ {0, 1}, ∀n ∈ N , C6 : qmin ≤ q[n] ≤ qmax, ∀n ∈ N , C7 : Pu[n] ≤ Pmax, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\nwhere Rd,k[n] is the GN data rate which is given by\\n\\nRd,k[n] =\\n\\n\\uf8f1 \\uf8f4\\uf8f2\\n\\n\\uf8f4\\uf8f3\\n\\n0, Bak[n]log2 Bak[n]log2\\n\\nÄ 1 + γRIS Ä 1 + γFD\\n\\nr,k[n]\\n\\nr,k[n]\\n\\nä\\n\\nä\\n\\nγd r,k[n] < γthr , γd r,k[n] > γthr, d = RIS , γd r,k[n] > γthr, d = FDR, (21)\\n\\nwhere γthr is an SNR threshold. In more detail, C1 forces the UAV trajectory to begin and end at the same point. In addition, C2 indicates that the UAV speed υ[n] cannot exceed the maximum UAV velocity υmax, while C3 defines that only one GN-BS pair can be served by the UAV-mounted RIS or the UAV-mounted FDR within a certain time slot. Moreover, C4 indicates that the UAV’s power consumption during its trajectory must not exceed its battery’s available energy, while C5 and C6 set the lower and upper bounds for the optimization variables a, q, with C6 ensuring the UAV remains within the predefined rectangular field. Lastly, C7 describes that the UAV’s transmission power should be less than Pmax, denoting the peak power limit of the UAV, where for the UAV-mounted RIS case, Pu[n] = 0 as the RIS does not consume any transmission power.\\n\\nB. Problem Solution\\n\\nAs it can be seen, problem (P1) is intractable since it contains both continuous and integer variables while its ob- jective function is non-convex. To this end, given that current optimization methods struggle with problems containing non- linear constraints paired with integer variables, a separation of the integer variable A and the continuous variable Q becomes essential. To address this, the alternate optimization technique is employed, which relies on successively optimizing each\\n\\n6\\n\\noptimization variable block until convergence [26]. Therefore, for a fixed trajectory Q we have (cid:40) N (cid:88)\\n\\n(cid:41)\\n\\nmax A\\n\\nmin k\\n\\nRd,k[n]\\n\\nn=1\\n\\ns.t C1 :\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nak[n] ≤ 1, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(PA.1)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nC2 : ak[n] ∈ {0, 1}, ∀n ∈ N .\\n\\nAs it can be seen, problem (PA.1) is an integer programming in canonical form, since the problem, however, objective function is a non-linear function. Thus, by utilizing the auxiliary variable rmin, problem (PA.1) is equivalently written as\\n\\nit\\n\\nis not\\n\\nmax A,rmin\\n\\nrmin\\n\\ns.t C1 :\\n\\nK (cid:88)\\n\\nak[n] ≤ 1, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\nk=1\\n\\n(PA.2)\\n\\nC2 : ak[n] ∈ {0, 1}, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\nC3 :\\n\\nN (cid:88)\\n\\nak[n]Rd,k[n] ≥ rmin, ∀k ∈ K,\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nwhich is a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP), since for given trajectory Q, Rd,k[n] is constant for either the FDR or the RIS case. As a consequence, (PA.2) can be optimally solved using off-the-self optimization tools such as the Branch and Bound method.\\n\\n1) Optimization of Q: Given the TDMA schedule A,\\n\\nproblem (P1) can be written as\\n\\nmax Q\\n\\nmin k\\n\\n(cid:40) N (cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nak[n]Rd,k[n]\\n\\n(cid:41)\\n\\ns.t C1 : q[1] = q[N ],\\n\\nC2 : υ[n] ≤ υmax, ∀n ∈ N , N (cid:88)\\n\\nC3 : Bc − δt\\n\\nPd[n] ≥ 0,\\n\\n(PQ.1)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\nC4 : qmin ≤ q[n] ≤ qmax, ∀n ∈ N , C5 : Pu[n] ≤ Pmax, ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\nwhich is a non-convex problem due to the non-concave and dual branch objective function Rd,k[n]. Furthermore, in (20), Pd[n] is influenced by the UAV’s speed υ[n], which is derived from the differences in consecutive positions xq[n] and yq[n], thus, given that these positions are constants for each time slot, the relationship of Pd[n] with xq and yq is affine, as it comprises linear differences and constant terms. Thus, Pd[n] is by definition convex which makes constraint C3 convex as well. In addition, by introducing the auxiliary variable rmin, problem (PQ.1) is equivalently transformed as follows\\n\\ns.t\\n\\nmax xq,yq,rmin (PQ.1) : C1, C2, C3, C4, C5\\n\\nrmin\\n\\nC6 :\\n\\nN (cid:88)\\n\\nRd,k[n] ≥ rmin, ∀k ∈ K.\\n\\n(PQ.2)\\n\\nn=1, ak[n]=1\\n\\nAgain, problem (PQ.2) is still non-convex due to C6. To tackle this, we can convert it from a dual branch function into a single function by introducing an appropriate constraint that assures that the UAV always serves a GN for which the received SNR at the BS-side is above γthr. Additionally, ∀n ∈ N and ∀k ∈ K for which ak[n] = 1, we can introduce the auxiliary variables rk[n], thus the problem (PQ.2) can be rewritten as\\n\\ns.t\\n\\nrmin\\n\\nmax xq,yq,rmin,rk[n] (PQ.1) : C1, C2, C3, C4, C5\\n\\nC6 :\\n\\nN (cid:88)\\n\\nrk[n] ≥ rmin, ∀k ∈ K\\n\\nn=1, ak[n]=1 C7 : γd r,k[n] ≥ γthr, ∀n ∈ N , ∀k ∈ K that ak[n] = 1, C8 : Rd,k[n] ≥ rk[n], ∀n ∈ N , ∀k ∈ K that ak[n] = 1. (PQ.3) Due to the distinct achievable rates of the UAV-mounted RIS and the UAV-mounted FDR, C7 and C8 have to be dealt differently for each case. To this end, the distinct approaches for the two cases are presented below.\\n\\nUAV-mounted RIS: Utilizing (6) and defining AR = 4M 2, we adopt the approximation log2(1 + γtGC0 z) ≈ log2(z). This choice is motivated by the dominant high SNR conditions inherent in our system, particularly under LoS scenarios. In fact, given the UAV’s strategic positioning relative to the GNs it serves, z is typically large, making the approximation increasingly pertinent. Thus, C8 can be expressed as C8 : log2(d1[n]\\n\\n2d0\\n\\nÇ d2[n] AR\\n\\nå\\n\\n2\\n\\n2) + log2\\n\\n≤ −rk[n].\\n\\n(22)\\n\\nFurthermore, by introducing the auxiliary variables 2) ≤ sk,n, and sk,n and tk[n], such that log2(d2[n]\\n\\nlog2(d1[n]\\n\\n2) ≤ tk[n], C6 and C8 are rewritten as\\n\\nC6 :\\n\\nN (cid:88)\\n\\nn=1\\n\\n(cid:0)sk[n] + tk[n]\\n\\n(cid:1) ≤ −rmin,\\n\\n(23)\\n\\nC8 : sk[n] + tk[n] ≤ −rk[n],\\n\\nwhile the following constraints occur as well: C8.A : (xq[n] − xk)2 + (yq[n] − yk)2 + H 2\\n\\nu − 2sk,n ≤ 0\\n\\nC8.B :\\n\\n(xq[n] − xb)2 + (yq[n] − yb)2 + (Hu − HBS)2 AR\\n\\n− 2tk[n] ≤ 0.\\n\\n(24) We note that constraint C7 can be handled in the same way, by introducing the auxiliary variables ˆsk[n] and ˆtk[n]. Then, the convex form of C7 is equivalently given as follows C7 : ˆsk[n] + ˆtk[n] ≤ − log(γthr), C7.A : (xq[n] − xk)2 + (yq[n] − yk)2 + H 2\\n\\nu − 2ˆsk[n] ≤ 0\\n\\nC7.B :\\n\\n(xq[n] − xb)2 + (yq[n] − yb)2 + (Hu − HBS)2 AR\\n\\n− 2ˆtk[n] ≤ 0.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nTo address the non-convexity introduced by the new constraints C7.A, C7.B, C8.A, C8.B, the successive ap- proximation method (SCA) is employed [26]. Thus, by substituting the non-convex terms with their first-order Taylor approximation, we formulate the convex opti- mization problem for the trajectory design in the UAV- mounted RIS scenario as follows:\\n\\ns.t\\n\\nmax xq,yq,rmin, rk[n],sk,n,tk[n] (PQ.3) : C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8 C7.A : (xq[n] − xk)2 + (yq[n] − yk)2 + Hu\\n\\nrmin\\n\\n2\\n\\n− 2ˆsk[n],0 − (ˆsk[n] − ˆsk[n],0)2ˆsk[n],0 ≤ 0\\n\\nC7.B :\\n\\n(xq[n] −xb)2 + (yq[n] −yb)2 + (Hu −HBS)2 AR\\n\\n− 2ˆtk[n],0 − (ˆtk[n] − ˆtk[n],0)2ˆtk[n],0 ≤ 0,\\n\\nC8.A : (xq[n] − xk)2 + (yq[n] − yk)2 + Hu\\n\\n2\\n\\n− 2sk[n],0 − (sk,n − sk[n],0)2sk[n],0 ≤ 0\\n\\nC8.B :\\n\\n(xq[n] −xb)2 + (yq[n] −yb)2 + (Hu −HBS)2 AR\\n\\n− 2tk[n],0 − (tk[n] − tk[n],0)2tk[n],0 ≤ 0,\\n\\n(PQ.4-RIS) where sk[n],0, tk[n],0, ˆsk[n],0, ˆtk[n],0 are the arbitrary initial points for the Taylor approximation. Remark 2: For the case in the UAV-mounted RIS scenario where the trajectory’s initial point coincides with the BS location and the path loss exponents of the BS-RIS and RIS-GN channels are equal, the optimal trajectory is to hover at the UAV’s battery is depleted. This strategy maximizes the network’s data rate by achieving the minimum overall path loss through minimal UAV-BS distance due to the double path loss phenomenon, and simultaneously minimizes energy con- sumption, capitalizing on the UAV’s hovering state. • UAV-mounted FDR: For the UAV-mounted FDR case,\\n\\nthis point until\\n\\nthe constraint C7 can be equivalently written as\\n\\nC7.A :\\n\\nC7.B :\\n\\n2\\n\\n(xq[n] − xk)2 + (yq[n] − yk)2 + Hu AFD,1[n]\\n\\n1 γthr (xq[n] − xb)2 + (yq[n] − yb)2 + (Hu − HBS)2 AFD,2[n]\\n\\n≤\\n\\n≤\\n\\n1 γthr\\n\\n,\\n\\n(26) which is convex. Furthermore, by utilizing (7), (10), and (11), and considering that the condition min{x, y} ≥ t implies that both x ≥ t and y ≥ t, thus, C8 in PQ.3 can be equivalently divided into two separate constraints: (cid:0)AFD,1[n]d1[n] (cid:0)AFD,2[n]d2[n]\\n\\n−2(cid:1) ≥ rk[n], −2(cid:1) ≥ rk[n],\\n\\nC8.A : log2 C8.B : log2\\n\\n2GtAr\\n\\nwhere AFD,1[n] = PtC0d0 AtGrPu[n]C0d0 σ2\\n\\nAtGrPu[n]ω+σ2 , and AFD,2[n] = .

The procedure for the joint TDMA-trajectory design, for both the UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDR cases, is outlined in Algorithm 1. It is worth noting that the values for iter1 and iter2 are selected to ensure that the solutions from both the SCA and alternate optimization methods converge to a consistent solution [26], which is then presented as the final output of Algorithm 1.\\n\\nAlgorithm 1 Trajectory Design for UAV-mounted RIS or UAV-mounted FDR\\n\\n1: Initialize iter1, iter2 Bc, δt, vmax, Uw, Dw, Rw,d 2: for N = Nmin, Nmin + 1, ...., Nmax do 3: 4: 5:\\n\\nInitialize Ainit, Qinit for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., iter1 do\\n\\nFor Qinit, solve (PA.2) and obtain Ai for j = 0, 1, 2, ..., iter2 do\\n\\n6: 7:\\n\\nFor Ai, solve (PQ.4-FDR) or (PQ.4-RIS)\\n\\n8:\\n\\nand obtain Qj rk[n],0 ← rj\\n\\nk[n], sk[n],0 ← sj\\n\\nk[n], tk[n],0 ← tj\\n\\nend for Qinit ← Qiter2\\n\\n9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: end for 15: Obtain the best Q∗ and A∗\\n\\nend for Q∗ ← Qiter2 For Q∗, solve (PA.2) and obtain A∗\\n\\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS\\n\\nIn this section, we present numerical results to assess the performance of the proposed UAV-assisted communication scenarios, whose power consumption and network parameters are set as detailed in Table I and Table II, respectively. Specifically, we consider an uplink communication system assisted by i) a UAV-mounted RIS or ii) a UAV-mounted FDR with 10 GNs that transmit with power equal to Pt = 0 dBm, that are also randomly distributed over a rectangular area with sides equal to L = 750 m, unless otherwise stated. In addition, a single-antenna BS is located in the origin of the rectangular area which also serves as a UAV CS. It should be mentioned that, in alignment with practical scenarios, we\\n\\nk[n]\\n\\nTABLE I: POWER CONSUMPTION MODEL PARAMETERS\\n\\nParameter UAV weight Reflecting element weight Antenna weight Battery weight Battery capacity Reflecting element consumption Controller consumption Inverse of pow. ampl. drain eff.

Moreover, it is assumed that the UAV-mounted RIS is equipped with the MN505-s KV320 T-MOTOR motors due to its weight, while the lighter UAV-mounted FDR uses the AT4130 KV230 T-MOTOR motors. Moreover, the size of the UAV frame, combined with the size of each reflecting element as outlined in Table I, allows for a maximum of 1600 reflecting elements to be fitted on the UAV frame. In contrast, for the UAV-mounted FDR, the frame can accommodate a maximum of 12 antennas, arranged as a uniform linear array (ULA) with an inter-distance of λ 2 along the frame’s diagonal, for which we assume that At = Ar. In addition, we consider a benchmark TDMA scheduling scheme where (cid:5) time slots, to clearly show each GN is allocated NGN = (cid:4) N the efficiency of our algorithm. To be more precise, in the benchmark scheme, the UAV serves the nearest GN for NGN time slots and then serves the next nearest unserved GN, continuing until every GN has been served before returning to its initial location. Additionally, the benchmark trajectories are determined through a detailed search for the most effective combination of time slots and trajectory sizes, all considered within the operational limits of the UAV’s battery life. Finally, all of the results were calculated through Monte Carlo simu- lations with 1000 iterations.\\n\\nK\\n\\n8\\n\\n375\\n\\n375\\n\\n375\\n\\n250\\n\\n250\\n\\n250\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n(\\n\\n(\\n\\n(\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n.\\n\\nFig. 2: Benchmark UAV trajectories: (a) Circle (b) Rombus (c) Spiral.\\n\\nIn Fig. 2, three distinct benchmark UAV trajectories are illustrated, each serving as a feasible initial trajectory, denoted as Qinit, for the implementation of Algorithm 1. These tra- jectories include i) a straight line connecting the origin to the midpoint on the right side of the rectangular field, followed by a circle with radius L 2 centered at the axis origin; ii) a straight line connecting the origin to the midpoint on the right side of the rectangle, succeeded by a rhombus with sides √ measuring L 2 2 ; and iii) an Archimedean spiral described in polar coordinates by r = L 12π θ, with θ ∈ [0, 2π), followed by a straight line leading back to the origin. In the circular and rhombus trajectories, the UAV initially follows the straight line, completes the circle or rhombus, and then retraces its path along the straight line back to the origin, while in the trajectory the UAV navigates the spiral path before spiral returning to the origin via the straight line. Notably, in all these trajectories, the UAV navigates counter-clockwise, with the starting and ending points, q[1] and q[N ], aligning with the BS location. It should be highlighted that as shown in (1), the calculation of N based on Bc and Pd informs the minimum average speed required for the UAV to deplete its battery at the last point of the trajectory, thereby defining the feasible size of each trajectory within the allocated time slots. Specifically, the maximum number of time slots corresponds to the case where the UAV minimizes its power consumption (i.e., hovering), while reducing the number of time slots allows for larger trajectories. This indicates that an optimal number of time slots must be determined, as too many slots could restrict the UAV from performing large enough trajectories due to energy limitations, while fewer slots may limit service duration. Thus, the evaluation of different initial trajectories, each corresponding to a specific number of time slots is demanded, which can be done by initializing different values of N in step 1 of Algorithm 1 and selecting the value of N maximizing rmin.\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\n) s p b M\\n\\n60\\n\\n(\\n\\nn i m r\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\nL = 750 m L = 500 m L = 250 m Benchmark Algorithm 1\\n\\n0 600\\n\\n800\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n1,200\\n\\n1,400\\n\\n1,600\\n\\nM\\n\\nFig. 3: Minimum rate vs the number of reflecting elements M for σ2 = −144 dB.\\n\\n200\\n\\n180\\n\\n) s p b M\\n\\n160\\n\\n(\\n\\nn i m r\\n\\n140\\n\\n120\\n\\nL = 750 m L = 500 m L = 250 m Benchmark Algorithm 1\\n\\nIn Fig. 3, we illustrate the relationship between the net- work’s minimum rate rmin and the number of reflecting elements on the UAV-mounted RIS, with the noise power set at σ2 = −144 dB, for L = 750 m, 500 m, and 250 m, respectively.

As it can be observed, across all examined L cases, there exists an optimal number of reflecting elements which results from the improved channel gains and the increased energy consumption due to the weight of additional elements. Specifically, adding more reflecting elements increases the rate for each GN logarithmically, while the number of time slots decreases quadratically, in line with (14) and (17) for the case where the UAv speed is equal to zero (i.e., hovering state). Moreover, Fig. 3 shows that for larger L values, a higher number of reflecting elements is optimal, suggesting a strategy to mitigate excess path loss with shorter flight durations. How- ever, in smaller areas, a precise selection of reflecting elements is essential, as fewer elements can achieve enhanced coverage, thus negating the need for further increasing the reflecting elements and avoiding a compromise on the flight duration. Additionally, a key observation is the impact of the optimized user scheduling by Algorithm 1, which significantly reduces the required number of reflecting elements. For instance, under the benchmark scheduling for L = 750 m, 500 m, and 250 m, the optimal numbers of reflecting elements are 1550, 1500, and 1100, respectively, while with optimized user scheduling, these numbers reduce to 1350, 1150, and 950, respectively, emphasizing the advantages of network optimization in de- termining the optimal RIS size. Finally, in line with Remark 2, the optimal trajectory obtained from Algorithm 1 for the UAV-mounted RIS scenario, considering that q[1] coincides with the BS location, is the hovering trajectory, maximizing the minimum rate through minimized path loss and optimized energy use.\\n\\nFig. 4 shows the effect of the number of antennas on the UAV-mounted FDR on rmin, for σ2 = −144 dB and L = 750 m, 500 m, and 250 m, respectively. As it can be seen, decreas- ing the value of L and increasing the number of FDR antennas enhances rmin, with 12 antennas emerging as the optimal number for network performance. Furthermore, similarly to the UAV-mounted RIS scenario, the application of Algorithm 1 further enhances the minimum rate, demonstrating its value\\n\\n12\\n\\n20\\n\\n16\\n\\nBc = 30 Wh Bc = 45 Wh Bc = 60 Wh\\n\\n) s p b M\\n\\n12\\n\\n(\\n\\nn i m r\\n\\n8\\n\\n4\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n10\\n\\nAn\\n\\nFig. 6: Minimum rate versus UAV-mounted FDR Antennas for σ2 = −114 dB, and L = 750 m for various battery capacities.\\n\\non the network performance improvement. Interestingly, under the network parameters in Table II, Algorithm 1 identifies the hovering trajectory as the optimal approach for all the examined cases, which is a notable deviation from the ex- pected optimization of the UAV-mounted FDR’s path loss at intermediate distances between a GN and the BS. Specifically, for the given network parameters, the received SNR for the GNs consistently stays above γthr across all L values, influencing the trajectory design, as it leads to the conclusion that maximizing the flight duration, thus serving the GNs from the initial UAV position, is more advantageous than moving the UAV to each GN’s optimal point, which results in the loss of time slots. In more detail, during the UAV’s traversal to these optimal points, there would be instances where the UAV is not optimally positioned to serve any GN, leading to inefficient use of energy and further loss of time slots. Finally, the results from Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the UAV-mounted FDR outperforms the UAV-mounted RIS for all values of L, even with 2 antennas on the FDR. This superior performance of the FDR is attributed to the severe impact of double path loss in the RIS scenario and the FDR’s lower energy consumption compared to the RIS, which incurs significant energy costs due to its weight. Additionally, the UAV-mounted FDR’s performance is favored as no extra energy is consumed for transitioning, despite potential path loss optimization for each GN. To this end, the provided results underscore the implications of UAV system choices on network practical performance, particularly emphasizing the balance between energy consumption and effective communication, while also highlighting the significant effect of the UAV motors over the energy required for the RIS and FDR operation in the UAV energy consumption.\\n\\nFig. 5 illustrates the trajectory optimization for a UAV- mounted FDR, comparing the solution from Algorithm 1 with the benchmark trajectories for which the benchmark TDMA scheme is applied, in a scenario with an increased noise power\\n\\n12\\n\\n10\\n\\n375\\n\\n375\\n\\n375\\n\\n250\\n\\n250\\n\\n250\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n)\\n\\nm\\n\\n125\\n\\n(\\n\\n(\\n\\n(\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\nh t d i W\\n\\n0\\n\\n−125\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−250\\n\\nGN BS\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n−375\\n\\n−375−250−125 0 125 250 375 Length (m)\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nFig. 7: Optimal UAV trajectories: (a) Bc = 30 Wh (b) Bc = 45 Wh (c) Bc = 60 Wh.\\n\\nof −114 dB for an area of L equal to 750 meters. In this scenario, unlike in Fig. 4 where σ2 = −144 dB and the UAV- mounted FDR remains stationary, the increased noise level results in areas where, if GNs are located within them, the received SNR falls below γthr, UAV movement is necessary to maintain effective communication. As it can be seen, for An = 12, the circular trajectory achieves a minimum rate of 0.51 Mbps, the rhombus 0.25 Mbps, and the spiral 0.28 Mbps, while the trajectory optimized through Algorithm 1 leads to a significantly higher rate of 12.28 Mbps. Moreover, for all examined trajectories, when the number of An is less than 6, the network’s minimum rate tends towards zero, due to the increased probability of GNs experiencing outages and the UAV’s battery limitations, which are insufficient to enable the UAV to serve all GNs effectively. Therefore, Fig. 5 emphasizes the critical interplay between the number of antennas, UAV battery capacity, and trajectory optimization in ensuring robust network performance, especially in scenarios with challenging communication conditions such as increased noise or γthr thresholds. Finally, it should be noted that for the UAV-mounted RIS case, if σ2 = −114dB then rmin = 0 across all the feasible M values, proving again the superiority of UAV-mounted FDR over UAV-mounted RIS in establishing communication link between the BS and the GNs.\\n\\nFinally, Fig. 6 depicts how rmin is affected by the number of antennas An of a UAV-mounted FDR across various battery capacities, Bc, showcasing how an increase in Bc leads to an improvement in the network’s minimum rate. Specifically, this enhancement occurs due to the UAV’s ability to allocate more time slots for serving each GN, which not only allows for more extensive service coverage but also enables the UAV to fly to more optimal locations for serving each GN, as the increased number of time slots extends the operational time before the battery depletes. Furthermore, Fig. 6 also indicates that the UAV to larger battery capacities permit execute broader trajectories, optimizing its positioning across the field to serve the GNs more effectively, while smaller battery capacities limit the trajectory size. Complementing this, Fig. 7 illustrates the optimal trajectory for a specific GN setup, which depicts the expansion in the size of the UAV’s trajectory as Bc increases. This expansion reflects the variation\\n\\nin the optimal number of time slots needed for different Bc, illustrating the direct relation between battery capacity and the effectiveness of the UAV’s flight path in enhancing network performance. Additionally, a notable aspect of these trajectories in Fig. 7, is the formation of a distinct spike in the bottom-left region of the trajectory for all analyzed battery capacities, which is a consequence of the strategic positioning needed to address the unfavorable location of the bottom-left GNs within the rectangular area. This contrasts with the right- hand side of the rectangular area, where the GNs are fewer in number, leading to a different trajectory pattern that does not necessitate such pronounced adjustments. To this end, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 underscore the effect of the battery capacity on trajectory optimization, while emphasizing their significance in ensuring robust network performance, particularly in scenarios with demanding communication conditions.\\n\\nV. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nIn this work, a thorough comparison between UAV-mounted RIS and UAV-mounted FDRs was performed, highlighting their distinct energy consumption patterns and underscor- ing the critical role of energy-aware design in UAV-based communication networks. Our results elucidated an optimal number of reflective elements for the RIS and antennas for the FDR, precisely tailored to the studied scenario, with our optimization algorithm suggesting a possible reduction in the optimal number of reflective elements. The analysis showed that increasing the number of reflective elements for the RIS logarithmically improves the rate for each GN, but also increases the energy consumption due to the added weight, which represents a trade-off between channel gain and energy efficiency. Despite the nearly passive nature of the RIS, its significant weight, coupled with the inherent double path loss, challenges its applicability in the considered scenario. In con- trast, the FDR was consistently identified as a more efficient solution, optimizing network fairness through its favorable path loss without significantly impacting the UAV’s energy consumption. Furthermore, the primary energy consumption factor was identified as the UAV’s motors, highlighting the importance of lightweight design, especially for UAV-mounted RIS systems. Finally, it was shown that the UAV’s battery\\n\\n11\\n\\nenergy significantly influences the optimal trajectory, forcing the UAV to move only when necessary to minimize energy thus emphasizing the importance of energy consumption, awareness in the strategic operation of UAV-assisted networks. Therefore, our study lays the foundation for future exploration of advanced RIS technologies, e.g., metasurface-based RIS and non-orthogonal multiple access schemes, which promise to unravel complex dynamics and further improve the efficiency and sustainability of UAV-assisted communication networks.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n[1] M.

During reflow process, once deposited solder pastes start melting, electronic components move in a direction that achieve their highest symmetry. This motion is known as self-alignment since can correct potential mounting misalignment. In this study, two noticeable machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) are proposed as a prediction technique to (1) diagnose the relation among component self-alignment, deposited solder paste status and placement machining parameters, (2) predict the final component position on PCB in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions before entering in the reflow process. Based on the prediction result, a non-linear optimization model (NLP) is developed to optimize placement parameters at initial stage. Resultantly, RFR outperforms in terms of prediction model fitness and error. The optimization model is run for 6 samples in which the minimum Euclidean distance from component position after reflow process from ideal position (i.e., the center of pads) is outlined as 25.57 (𝜇𝑚) regarding defined boundaries in model.\\n\\nKeywords: Passive chip Component self alignment; optimal placement parameters setting; machine learning; predictive modeling; optimization-based modeling; pick and placement process; surface mount technology\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nSurface mount technology (SMT) is an advanced method in electronic packaging in which solder paste provides electrical connection between surface mount components (SMCs) and electronic circuit. Three main operations are accomplished to produce assembled electronic circuit, including stencil printing process (SPP), pick and placement process (P&P), and reflow soldering. At first, solder paste is deposited onto the surface of printing circuit board (PCB). Then SMCs are placed automatically with the aim of P&P machine. Finally, solder joints which are formed by employed heat during reflow process, attach SMCs on PCB permanently. SMT enhances electronic packages by utilization of smaller packages, smaller circuit boards [1], smaller components, etc. On one side, miniaturization makes component placement more challenging since more accurate component placement is required with smaller size of packages with larger lead counts [1]. On the other side, mounted components move during reflow soldering process unintentionally because of the forces that acting on component when solder paste starts wetting. These phenomena is known as the ‘self-alignment’ and originated from the surface tension of molted solder that empowers component to move in a direction that achieves its equilibrium state [2]. So, to obtain the knowledge of how and how much chip components move during reflow concerning their initial status such as components geometry (miniaturized chip components), designed pad geometry, deposited solder paste status, and placement strategy, would be critical and brings the opportunity of optimizing placement parameter setting that reduces components positional offsets after reflow soldering.\\n\\nHowever, numerous studies have investigated chip component self-alignment capability from theoretical [1], simulation and numerical [1, 3] models’ standpoints, there is no generalized data-driven model in literature to address practical challenges of self-alignment [4]. Lv et al. provided a comprehensive survey on machine learning application in SMT [4]. Based on this survey, there is no research to employ applied machine learning method in self-alignment [4] while applied machine learning methods privilege over conventional statistical methods in SMT [5]. Despite a recently published paper by Marktinek et al. that used a one-layer neural network to predict component position after reflow regarding of its placement offsets in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions [6] while neglecting other factors. Moreover,\\n\\nthe overarching goal of developing a self-alignment prediction model is preventing potential defects such as tombstoning, overhanging, etc. before entering reflow process. Particularly, tombstoning happens when SMCs are lifted from a pad on one end in which electrical connection between SMCs and PCB would be broken. Overhanging refers to the situation when SMCs land off from their pad in 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions. Accurate SMCs placement regarding deposited solder paste volume and offsets can reduce the possibility of tombstoning and overhanging. So, an optimization model that optimizes placement setting could be accomplished with the prediction model to avoid such defects. For the best of our knowledge, no optimization model in the literature addresses placement machining setting in P&P process. Hence, this enhances the necessities of: (1) obtaining insight of factors that contribute in component self-alignment, (2) developing a generalized data-driven model that addresses different type and size of chip components, (3) outlining machine learning algorithm that predicts chip components position after reflow soldering, (4) determining the best placement machining parameters that enhances the quality of finished electronic package. This study considers 6 types of passive chip components (3 resistors and 3 capacitors). A generalized optimization- prediction model could be a breakthrough in surface mount assembly (SMA) line since on one side, all previous studies considered only one or two types of passive chip components self-alignment [3, 5, 6] and on the other side, there is no optimization-prediction model that addresses placement machining strategy.\\n\\nFrom the extensive research and based on the domain knowledge, 13 variables are selected to train the prediction models, and three targets are defined as components offsets after reflow process, naming as post offset 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotation (𝜃) (i.e., post refers to component position after reflow process). Two remarkable machine learning algorithms including support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) are used. Then, we build a non-linear optimization (NLP) model to determine the optimized component placement setting by setting the controllable parameters in the P&P machine. The NLP model is solved with evolutionary strategy (ES) because of its complexity. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature related to components self-alignment; the built prediction models, optimization model and ES are discussed in Section 3 followed by results in Section 4; the conclusions and future work of this research are provided in Section 5.\\n\\n2. Literature review\\n\\nChip components capability of being self-aligned has been investigated in several studies with the means of dynamic fluid concepts which describe the scientific reason of this motion. Restoring forces, mainly force originating from surface tension, acts on components once solder paste is in its fluid state. This force drags chip components in a direction that achieves its symmetry. The primary challenge regarding this phenomenon is obtaining insight into factors that contribute to components movement. For this matter, the experimental result is accomplished with force models as well as simulation models in the literature. A dynamic force model proposed by [1] demonstrates the effect of pad geometry, chip metallization and dimensions, solder volume, and placement offsets on components motion during the reflow process. This study considered one type of capacitor named as 1206. Based on the results, smaller pad lengths, smaller pad gaps, larger solder volume, and smaller metallization provided better self-alignment for this capacitor [1]. The effect of different types of solder, different types of reflow technology, different solder paste volume and different placement angles on self-alignment have been studied in [7] in which the importance of solder volume on components self-alignment along with utilization of lead-free solders have been outlined [7]. Moreover, Liukkonen et al. compared component offsets before and after reflowing with leaded and lead-free processes [2]. However, they proposed that lead-free process has more variation in self-alignment comparing leaded process [2], other potential factors like paste volume and offsets are neglected from their study. Chip mass, die tilt, and solder volume variations and distributions have been considered in the regression model by [8] to optimize static equilibrium conditions of a flip-chip. They concluded that the solder volume variation has more significant influence on the chip standoff height (i.e., in the 𝑧 direction) than the chip lateral alignment accuracy (i.e., in 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions) [8].\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\nIn this section, a comprehensive description of the experiment and collected data are presented and contributing factors under this study are introduced. Furthermore, brief descriptions of applied machine learning techniques and their justification for this study are also presented. Finally, the optimization model is discussed along with the metaheuristic algorithm that is considered to solve the proposed optimization problem.\\n\\n3.1. Data description\\n\\nThe experiment is designed to assemble 6 passive chip component types, including 3 resistors and 3 capacitors in 3 size categories as R1005 and C1005 (1mm×0.5mm), R0603 and C0603 (0.6mm×0.3mm), and R0402 and C0402 (0.4mm×0.2mm).660 placements is considered for each component type (6 different components) which means 3940 placements in total. All components are placed horizontally on two corresponding pads (For detail, see Fig. 1). Longer and shorter sides of the component are considered as parallel with 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions respectively, and rotation is defined as a circular movement on 𝑥-axis. The red dot in the Fig. 1 indicates the center of two pads which is considered as a reference point (i.e., {0, 0}). At first stage, the solder paste is deposited on the PCB and various factors including paste volume ratio on pad 1 and 2, and paste offsets (𝑥 and 𝑦) on pad 1 and 2 are measured with the means of advanced solder paste inspection (SPI) machine. Fig. 1(a) presents solder paste positional factors in 𝑥𝑦-plane. Volume average ratio and volume difference ratio are defined as the average and difference of deposited volume on pad 1 and pad 2 respectively. Then, components are placed with intentional offsets in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational (𝜃) directions with the aid of\\n\\n(\\n\\n(\\n\\nFig. 1. positional relation of pads, solder pastes and component in 𝑥𝑦-plane.

Support vector regression (SVR)\\n\\nThe SVR is a prediction technique that is able to solve complex nonlinear regression problems by mapping input features into high-dimensional space 𝐹, wherein they are linearly correlated with the problem target. For a given training set with sample size 𝑛; {(𝑥1, 𝑦1), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)} ⊂ 𝑋 × ℝ where 𝑋 denotes the space of input features (𝑋 = ℝ𝑑, 𝑑 is number of features) and ℝ is the set of real numbers for continuous target 𝑦, the SVR method fits hyperplane 𝐹(𝑋) = 〈𝑤, 𝑥〉 + 𝑏, in which most data points fall on this plane [9]. Note that 〈 . , . 〉 denotes the dot product of any\\n\\ntwo arbitrary vectors. The distance of 𝜀 and – 𝜀 from defined hyperplane is defined as marginal tolerance range to ∗ penalize prediction point out of this boundary with a predefined penalty ratio of 𝐶 ∑ (𝜉𝑖 + 𝜉𝑖 in which 𝜉𝑖 and 𝜉𝑖 denotes the amount of deviation from defined hyperplane for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 , where 𝑛 is data size. The SVR estimation function and corresponding constraints are shown in Eq. (1) and (2) in which the objective is minimizing the norm of hyperplane weight (𝑤) and penalty to balance the hyperplane and its tolerance margins.\\n\\n𝑛 𝑖=1\\n\\n∗)\\n\\n𝑚𝑖𝑛\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n∗) ∥ 𝑤 ∥2+ 𝐶 ∑ (𝜉𝑖 + 𝜉𝑖\\n\\n𝑛 𝑖=1\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n𝑠. 𝑡. {\\n\\n𝑦𝑖 − 〈𝑤, 𝑥𝑖〉 − 𝑏 ≤ 𝜀 + 𝜉𝑖 ∗ −𝑦𝑖 + 〈𝑤, 𝑥𝑖〉 + 𝑏 ≤ 𝜀 + 𝜉𝑖 ∗ ≥ 0 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛 𝜉𝑖 , 𝜉𝑖\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIn this study, the ε-insensitive loss function is considered along with the linear kernel. For the SVR setting, we set\\n\\n𝜀 = 0.1 as the distance of boundaries from hyperplane and 𝐶 =1 as the penalty ratio.\\n\\n3.3. Random forest regression (RFR)\\n\\nThe RFR is an ensemble prediction technique which is built based on a collection of randomized regression trees. In RFR, each randomly selected tree employs random split on feature space with the objective of reducing prediction error. Finally, RFR, acquires the mean of individual outputs to get more stable prediction [10]. For a given training set with sample size 𝑛; {(𝑥1, 𝑦1), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)} ⊂ 𝑋 × ℝ , where 𝑋 denotes the space of input features (𝑋 = ℝ𝑑, 𝑑 is the number of features) and ℝ is the set of real numbers for continuous target 𝑦, a random forest is defined as a hierarchical tree-structured predictor [10] in which: 𝐹(𝑥) = , where 𝐽 is the number of trees in the forest and 𝑓𝑗(𝑥) is 𝑓𝑗(𝑥) the estimation function of 𝑗th tree that is trained on a random split of input features [10]. For a decision tree with 𝑀 in which:𝑓𝑗(𝑥) = splitting nodes, the ∑ ; 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽, where 𝑏𝑚 is the corresponding constant for each region. 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚) is the binary decision function that shows whether input feature 𝑥 is selected (i.e., 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚)=1 if 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅𝑚) or not ( 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚) = 0 if 𝑥 ∉ 𝑅𝑚). In this study, the number of trees is initialized as 50 and trees are fully grown.\\n\\n1\\n\\n𝐽 𝑗=1\\n\\n∑\\n\\n𝐽\\n\\nfeature space would be splitting\\n\\ninto 𝑀\\n\\nregions as 𝑅𝑚\\n\\n𝑀 𝑚=1\\n\\n𝑏𝑚 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚)\\n\\n3.4. Passive chip component placement NLP model\\n\\nThe placement parameters that are needed to be optimized are the last 3 continuous variables (𝜒𝑑; 𝑑 ∈ 𝐷 = {1,2,3}) shown in Table 2, and a combination of them represents a placement setting for specific component placement in mounting process. The first 6 continuous variables (𝛾𝑖; 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 = {1, … ,6}) in Table 2, are solder paste properties corresponding each pad. Finally, the 4 categorical variables (𝜆𝑗; 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽; 𝐽 = {1, … ,4}) in\\n\\nTable 1 indicates a specific component directory and its corresponding pad directory that is designed to be placed on PCB. The solder paste properties-related variables and component and pad directory-related variables are considered as features in training SVR and RFR prediction models to capture the effect of different components and solder paste status on components self-alignment. These variables are given variables in optimization model. The main objective of the NLP model is to reduce the Euclidean distance of component position after reflow soldering from reference point (𝑅𝑥, 𝑅𝑦) (see Eq. (3)). Rotational offset (𝜃) is also addressed as a hard constraint in Eq. (4). The proposed NLP model considers optimization for component position in 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝜃 directions with a user predefined threshold for each (see Eq. (4)-(6)). The reason behind this is that no placement would accrue with zero offset concerning ideal position in real production line. The list of notations used to drive the objective function and constraints of the proposed NLP optimization model is shown in Table 3. The functional values are estimated based on the trained SVR and RFR prediction models, as shown:\\n\\nTable 3. list of notations\\n\\nNotation\\n\\nName\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nIndices and Sets\\n\\nVariables\\n\\n𝑑 ∈ 𝐷\\n\\n𝑖 ∈ 𝐼 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽 𝑘 ∈ 𝐾 𝜒\\n\\n𝛾 𝜆\\n\\nSet of decision variables in optimization model; placement parameters setting in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions Set of given continuous variables in prediction model; solder paste properties-related factors Set of given categorical variables in prediction model; component and pad directory-related factors Set of level of categorical variables; 𝐿 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Decision variable; placement parameters setting Given continuous variable in prediction model Given categorical variable\\n\\n(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝜃) Component positional offsets in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions\\n\\nParameters\\n\\nFunction\\n\\n𝜏 𝐿𝑑, 𝑈𝑑 𝐹\\n\\nThreshold of prediction-optimization constraint Lower and upper bounds for placement parameter 𝑑, respectievely Prediction function (SVR and RFR)\\n\\n𝑚𝑖𝑛 √∥ 𝑅𝑥 − 𝐹𝑥(𝜆𝑗𝑘, 𝛾𝑖, 𝜒𝑑) ∥2 + ∥ 𝑅𝑦 − 𝐹𝑦(𝜆𝑗𝑘, 𝛾𝑖, 𝜒𝑑) ∥2\\n\\n𝑠. 𝑡. |𝐹𝜃(𝜆𝑗𝑘, 𝛾𝑖, 𝜒𝑑)| ≤ 𝜏𝜃\\n\\n|𝐹𝑥(𝜆𝑗𝑘, 𝛾𝑖, 𝜒𝑑)| ≤ 𝜏𝑥\\n\\n|𝐹𝑦(𝜆𝑗𝑘, 𝛾𝑖, 𝜒𝑑)| ≤ 𝜏𝑦\\n\\n𝐿𝑑 ≤ 𝜒𝑑 ≤ 𝑈𝑑; 𝑑 ∈ 𝐷; 𝑖 ∈ 𝐼; 𝑗 ∈ 𝐽; 𝑘 ∈ 𝐾\\n\\nThe thresholds (i.e., 𝜏𝜃, 𝜏𝑥, 𝜏𝑦 ) in Eq. (4)-(6) are considered as customer defined expectation limits and are defined as 𝜏𝜃 = 2 degree, 𝜏𝑥 = 20% of pad length (𝜇𝑚), 𝜏𝑦 = 20% of pad width (𝜇𝑚) in this study, based on experts’ opinion. Furthermore, since the aim of this model is to drive a placement strategy for a given component and pad directory and solder paste properties, decision variables are limited with lower and upper boundaries in which lower bound presents center of two pads and upper bound presents center of two printed pastes for decision variables 𝜒1 and 𝜒2 such that (𝐿𝜒1, 𝑈𝜒1) = (𝑅𝑥, (𝛾3 + 𝛾5) 2⁄ ) and (𝐿𝜒2, 𝑈𝜒2) = (𝑅𝑦, (𝛾4 + 𝛾6) 2⁄ ). Concerning upper bound of 𝜒3, the slope of two deposited solder pastes is calculated as (𝐿𝜒3, 𝑈𝜒3) = (𝑅𝜃, 𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛((𝛾4 − 𝛾6) (𝛾3 − 𝛾5\\n\\n⁄\\n\\n))).\\n\\n3.5. Solution approach\\n\\nSince the proposed optimization model involves probabilistic SVR and RFR prediction functions in its formulation (non-linear functions), it is hard to solve with deterministic optimization. For this matter, a population-based metaheuristic method, evolutionary strategy (ES), is used [11] to find the optimal placement setting for proposed NLP problem. Basically, ES saves the best from a population to amend next generation [11]. So, in the end, the best population survives with ES. ES is chosen in this research rather than other population-based metaheuristics because the optimization problem of this research consists of continuous and categorical variables with real-valued decision variables. So, ES makes the configuration of proposed NLP simpler in terms of encoding real-valued variables [11]. Moreover, ES converges to an optimal or near optimal solution faster than other methods such as genetic algorithm (GA) [11]. The formulation in [11] is modified for proposed NLP as shown in Algorithm 1. The proposed algorithm employs normal distribution 𝑁(0, 𝜎) to produce offspring and (𝜇, 𝜆)-ES is used as a selection strategy in which best children are selected to create the next generation [11].\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nAlgorithm 1.

Results and discussion\\n\\nThe result of experiment is divided in 70: 10: 20 as training: validating: testing sets in order to: (1) train SVR and RFR prediction models on the training set and tune the parameters of models with validating set; (2) test SVR and RFR models with the unseen testing set. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (𝑅2) is employed to measure the fitness of learning algorithm on training set along with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) which is used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model on testing set. Table 4 presents the 𝑅2 value of training set and an RMSE value of testing set for SVR and RFR prediction models.\\n\\nTable 4.

The model is fitted with 𝑅2 value of 94%, 95%, and 87% for components offset after reflow soldering in 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝜃 directions respectively. Moreover, RFR model predicts components position after reflow soldering with 15.48 (𝜇𝑚), 12.65 (𝜇𝑚), and 1.56 (deg.) prediction error in 𝑥, 𝑦, and 𝜃 directions respectively. At the next step, the probabilistic function of RFR is employed in the optimization model. Basically, RFR’s mathematical mapping function from input feature space to output space, is used in optimization model. So, for any given solution in feature space such as solder paste average volume ratio, the optimization model searches for optimal component position before reflow soldering (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝜃 ) in which it has minimum offsets after reflow soldering (see NLP formulation in section 3.4). To show the result, we run the optimization model for six samples, each component type once. In Fig. 2, the pink triangle shows actual result from experiment and violet rectangle presents optimized result for component offset before and after reflow soldering respectively. It is worthy to mention that components position is not necessary equal before and after reflow soldering because components move during reflow process by the self-alignment effect. As mentioned before, the aim of this study is finding the best placement in respect of such motion during reflow process. Based on the results, the optimization model is terminated with the objective value of 25.57 (i.e., component distance from ideal position after reflow process) for all samples regarding proposed boundaries and thresholds in\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n(d)\\n\\n(e)\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nFig. 2. experiment result ( actual) vs. optimized components offsets (a) before reflow soldering in 𝑥 direction; (b) before reflow soldering in 𝑦 direction; (c) before reflow soldering in rotational direction; (d) after reflow soldering in x direction; (e) after reflow soldering in y direction; (f) after reflow soldering in rotational direction\\n\\nsection 3.4. As shown in Fig. 2, optimal placement parameter (i.e., violet rectangle) varies dramatically from actual placements in our experiment. To achieve the least offsets after reflow soldering, it is suggested to place components with initial offsets of (0, 50) (𝜇𝑚) in 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions and (-2, 2) (deg.) for rotation. Moreover, rerunning the experiment with optimized placement parameters could verify this optimization model.

Conclusion and future work\\n\\nThis study employed 13 potential factors that contribute in components movement during reflow soldering and applied two magnitude machine learning approaches as SVR and RFR to predict passive chip components position after reflow soldering in 𝑥, 𝑦 and rotational directions. Then an NLP model is developed to optimize component placement setting including placement in 𝑥, 𝑦 and rotational directions with the objective of minimizing the probability function of proposed prediction models. Based on the result, RFR outperforms in terms of training fitness and prediction error and is chosen for the optimization model. The optimization results, which are examined on 6 samples, show the objective value as 25.57 (𝜇𝑚) that indicates the minimum Euclidean distance from component position after reflow process from ideal position (i.e., center of pads) regarding considered boundaries and thresholds in the model. Moreover, placement parameters for each sample is also retrieved. Based on the result for these 6 samples, optimal\\n\\nplacement setting is between (0, 50) (𝜇𝑚) in 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions and between (-2, 2) (deg.) for rotation based on specific given factors including solder paste average and difference volume ratio and solder paste offsets (𝑥 and 𝑦). It is also recommended to verify optimization results with real experiment.\\n\\nHowever, the proposed prediction-optimization model is the first in component self-alignment, but four main areas would be recommended as future works. Specifically, it is to: (1) develop the multi-target prediction model that considers all targets simultaneously; (2) reduce prediction error with the aid of advanced machine learning techniques such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.; (3) consider all prediction targets in objective function of optimization model; (4) design stochastic version of the optimization model instead of deterministic model to address errors origination from prediction model as well as random error in the machinary operations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] J.

       " Document(page_content='Data-Driven Prediction Model of Components Shift during Reflow Process in Surface Mount Technology\\n\\nIrandokht Parviziomran, Shun Cao, Krishnaswami Srihari, Daehan Won\\n\\naDepartment of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, New York 13902\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nIn surface mount technology (SMT), mounted components on soldered pads are subject to move during reflow process. This capability is known as self-alignment and is the result of fluid dynamic behaviour of molten solder paste. This capability is critical in SMT because inaccurate self-alignment causes defects such as overhanging, tombstoning, etc. while on the other side, it can enable components to be perfectly self-assembled on or near the desire position. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the components movement during reflow in 𝑥 and 𝑦-directions as well as rotation. Our study is composed of two steps: (1) experimental data are studied to reveal the relationships between self-alignment and various factors including component geometry, pad geometry, etc. (2) advanced machine learning prediction models are applied to predict the distance and the direction of components shift using support vector regression (SVR), neural network (NN), and random forest regression (RFR). As a result, RFR can predict components shift with the average fitness of 99%, 99%, and 96% and with average prediction error of 13.47 (µ𝑚), 12.02 (µ𝑚), and 1.52 (deg.) for component shift in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions, respectively. This enhancement provides the future capability of the parameters’ optimization in the pick and placement machine to control the best placement location and minimize the intrinsic defects caused by the self-alignment.\\n\\nKeywords: Electronic packaging; surface mount technology; passive chip components self-alignment; machine learning prediction model; predictive modeling; support vector regression, neural network, random forest regression.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nSurface mount technology (SMT) is an enhanced method in electronic packaging in which surface mount components (SMCs) are placed directly on the printed circuit boards (PCB). Basically, surface mount assembly (SMA) line contains three main operations as stencil printing process (SPP), pick and placement process (P&P), and reflow soldering. At first stage, solder paste is printed onto the pads of PCB to establish electrical connections, followed by picking and placing SMCs on their corresponding pads. Then, reflow oven is employed to attach SMCs by forming permanent solder joints. Basically, solder joint is formed by passing PCB through several thermal zones, known as thermal profile. First, PCB is preheated to start soaking. Then, temperature is increased by defined peak level to melt deposited solder paste. Finally, solder joint is formed by reducing the temperature in cooling zone. The amount of temperature and time that PCB spends at each zone is predefined based on factors, such as type of used solder paste, material and thickness of PCB, number and type of SMCs, etc. Moreover, fluid dynamic behavior of solder paste enforces SMCs to move during reflow process, once solder paste starts melting. Mainly, force originating from the surface tension empowers components to move in a direction that achieves the most magnificent symmetry [1] on the subject of its relative position with soldered pad [2]. This capability is well known as SMCs self-alignment, self- assembled, etc. However, there is no promises that self-alignment always compensates misplacing on P&P process, it can be used to optimize placement machining parameters.\\n\\nDespite numerous studies investigating the theoretical fundamentals of components movements during reflow [1- 8], there is no apparent justification to address practical challenges of the self-alignment in the real situation. On one side, there is no specific rule listed in the literature that recommends which control variables have a significant contribution in components movement in 𝑥, 𝑦-directions as well as rotation. On the other side, the widely applied methods are conceptual models along with simulation and numerical models that are accompanied by experimental results [3]. With respect to the privilege of data-driven techniques in compare with the conventional statistical methods [4] , there is a few data-driven model for predicting components movement as well as components position after reflow process. For instance, Lv et al. presented a comprehensive review of the application of data mining techniques in electronic industries [5]. According to their investigation, a few studies address the applied data mining technique in the printing process as well as the reflow process, but none of them studied components self-alignment from big data\\n\\nstandpoints [5]. Moreover, a study has been conducted by Marktinek et al. concurrently, which used a neural network model to predict components movement [6]. This study presented a one layer neural network to predict components position after reflow regarding its position before reflow in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions [6] while the importance of solder paste properties such as volume, offset, etc. are neglected. Hence, it enhances the necessities of: (1) obtaining insight into the most significant contributing factors in components shift, (2) outlining machine learning algorithm that predicts components movement during reflow concerning these factors. Moreover, a generalized prediction model that addresses different type and size of passive chip components movement could be a breakthrough of this area since all previous studies considered only one or two types of components [1, 3, 6, 7].\\n\\nFrom the extensive research conducted to develop this research [2, 7, 8], and the domain knowledge, 48 variables are selected to train the prediction models (see Fig. 1). These contributing factors are categorized as components geometry, pad geometry, solder paste inspection, placement inspection, paste-pad relative factors, placement-paste relative factors and placement-pad relative factors that are presented in Fig. 1. Furthermore, 3 targets are defined as components shift in 𝑥, 𝑦 direction, and rotation that are predicted with the help of remarkable machine learning algorithm, including support vector regression (SVR), deep neural network (NN), and random forest regression (RFR). The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature related to components self-alignment; the built prediction models are discussed in Section 3 followed by results in Section 4; the conclusions and future work of this research are provided in Section 5.\\n\\nFig. 1. contributing factors in components movement during reflow process; Notation: average volume, area, height, contact area, non- contact area and effective volume presents average of variable value in respect of pad 1 and pad 2; difference volume, area, height, contact area, non-contact area and effective volume presents difference of variable value on pad 1 subtracted from pad 2; division volume, area, height, contact area, non-contact area and effective volume presents division of variable value on pad 1 divided by pad 2; solder paste and placement offset presents their offsets (𝑥, 𝑦, and rotation) in respect of reference point which is the center of two pads; contact area presents the overlap area of each solder paste with its corresponding pad or overlap area of each solder paste with component; effective volume presents the amount of solder paste volume in respect of contact area.\\n\\n2. Literature review\\n\\nMany researchers studied components capability in being self-aligned during the reflow process. The main focus of these researches is analyzing experimental results along with simulation and numerical calculation that is built up based on dynamic fluid concepts. However, various studies address the theoretical aspect behind of components shift during reflow, there is not substantial data-driven study in this regard. Ellis and Masada presented a dynamic model in respect of chip capacitor behavior during the reflow process [8]. They studied the effects of various factors (e.g., pad geometry, solder volume, etc.). Presented model is based on calculated forces acting on component and the moment of their actions [8]. Liukkonen et al. studied the theoretical aspect of the self-alignment mechanism and compared components position before and after reflow in both lead-free and tin-lead processes with experimental results [1]. However, they outlined that there was more variation capability of self-alignment in the lead-free process [1], but other contributing factors rather than solder type is neglected from their experiment. Kong et al. predicted the accuracy of soldered flip chip assemblies based on chip mass, die tilt, and solder volume variations and distributions [7]. They applied a regression model that optimizes static equilibrium conditions of a chip and validated their result\\n\\nexperimentally. They concluded that the solder volume variation has greater influence on the chip standoff height (i.e., in the 𝑧-direction) than the chip lateral alignment accuracy (i.e., in 𝑥 and 𝑦-direction) [7]. Moreover, Dusek et al. studied components self-alignment in respect of three types of solders (one leaded and two lead-free) that have been deposited with five different angle offsets and two different volumes which is reflowed with two different reflow technologies [2]. Krammer investigated restoring forces that acting on passive chip component (0603) during reflow conceptually which is validated by a simulation model and experimental result [3].\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\nIn this section, we discuss machine learning techniques that are applied to predict passive chip components shift after the reflow process. At first, a comprehensive description of the experiment and collected data are presented and contributing factors under this study are introduced. Finally, a brief description of applied machine learning techniques and their justification for this study are presented.\\n\\n3.1. Data and experiment description\\n\\nThe experiment is designed to assemble 6 passive chip component types, including 3 resistors and 3 capacitors in 3 size categories as R1005 and C1005 (1mm×0.5mm), R0603 and C0603 (0.6mm×0.3mm), and R0402 and C0402 (0.4mm×0.2mm). The PCB is designed in which each above-named components are placed on two corresponding pads (named as pad1 and pad 2) that are covered with solder paste in SPP. Fig. 2 (a) shows the description of pads, solder pastes and component in 𝑥 and 𝑦 plane. The red dot in the Fig. 2 (a) indicates the center of two pads which is considered as a reference point (0, 0) in this study. Since all components are placed horizontally, longer and shorter sides of the component are considered as parallel with 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions respectively, and rotation is defined as a circular movement on 𝑥-axis (see Fig. 2 (b)). Initially, lead-free solder paste is deposited on the top of pads, concerning paste volume average, paste volume difference, and paste intentional offset (𝑥, 𝑦, rotation) as interest factors in SPP\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n+Rotation\\n\\n+y\\n\\n+x\\n\\nFig. 2. (a) pads, pastes and component description in 2D (x & y) plane; (b) a definition of the direction of components shift.\\n\\nstage. Then, components are placed with mounter machine, considering placement pressure and placement intentional offset (𝑥, 𝑦, rotation) as interest factors in P&P stage. Finally, all components are permanently attached on PCB through nitrogen reflow oven to minimize the effect of PCB’s surface oxidation. In detail, 33 combinations of above- mentioned interest factors are considered to place 6 types of passive chip components with 20 replications.\\n\\nDuring the reflow process, surface tension that is originated from liquid state of solder paste drags component to the center of pads in which component moves in 𝑥 and 𝑦-direction and rotates around 𝑥-axis. Basically, component shift is defined as the relative locational difference between component position before reflow stage and after reflow stage. Note that we consider such amount of the shift as a prediction target for our study. Specifically, we categorized all 48 factors into 7 groups as input features for the predictive modeling analysis (see Fig. 1). Among these 7 categories, the first two is obtained in respect of components directory and PCB design. It is worth mentioning that some detailed component properties like component plating type and thickness, weight, etc. are not considered in our study. Paste inspection and placement inspection are outlined from solder paste inspection (SPI) machine and pre reflow automated optical inspection (Pre-AOI) machine. The last three relative factors are calculated based on aforementioned categories.\\n\\n3.2. Data pre-processing\\n\\nHowever, this experiment is designed to place 3940 components in 6 type categories, but some components are missing during the P&P and reflow soldering processes that could be the result of defined placement job file or components floating in reflow stage. Since the cause of missing components is not under the scope of this study, these missing values are eliminated in our study (i.e., we just considered components that are permentley attached after reflow sodering process). Moreover, because of large enough data size, outliers are removed from dataset and gradually, the sample size is reduced to 3917 records with 48 factors. Furthermore, component type is coded as component size for three size categories and resistors and capacitors are distinguished by categorical values -1 and 1 respectively in order to provide a generalized prediction model for all type and size of passive chip components. In respect to dimensionality reduction, The Spearman correlation coefficient is applied to address the nonlinear dependency of continuous and ordinal factors and to remove factors that do not correlate with prediction targets [9].\\n\\n3.3. Support vector regression (SVR)\\n\\nThe general SVR formulation and concepts presented in this study is based on reviewing literatures [10, 11]. For a given training set {(𝑥1, 𝑦1), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)} ⊂ 𝑋 × 𝑅 where 𝑋 denotes the space of input features, the SVR method fits hyperplane 𝐹(𝑋) (Eq. (1)) where most data points fall on this plane.\\n\\n𝐹(𝑥) = 〈𝑤, 𝑥〉 + 𝑏; 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑤 ∈ 𝑋, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n, where 〈 . , . 〉 denotes the dot product of the two vectors. Moreover, upper and lower boundary lines with the distance of 𝜀 and – 𝜀 from defined hyperplane is fitted in which data points that fall within this margin of tolerance range will not be penalized while each point that falls out of this boundary would be penalized with the user defined ratio of 𝐶 in ∗. This constraint is known as ε-insensitive loss function. To respect of the amount of non-negative deviations 𝜉𝑖 and 𝜉𝑖 solve SVR estimation function, the objective is minimizing the norm of hyperplane weight (𝑤) with constrains of boundary lines which is presented in Eq. (2) and (3).\\n\\nmin (2)\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n𝑛 ∗) 2+ 𝐶 ∑ (𝜉𝑖 + 𝜉𝑖 𝑖=1\\n\\n∥ 𝑤 ∥2\\n\\n𝑠. 𝑡. {\\n\\n𝑦𝑖 − 〈𝑤, 𝑥𝑖〉 − 𝑏 ≤ 𝜀 + 𝜉𝑖 ∗ −𝑦𝑖 + 〈𝑤, 𝑥𝑖〉 + 𝑏 ≤ 𝜀 + 𝜉𝑖 ∗ ≥ 0 𝜉𝑖 , 𝜉𝑖\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nThe notable breakthrough of the SVR is using support vectors that makes the model independent from the dimensionality of input space 𝑋. It enables the algorithm to solve nonlinear problem efficiently. In this study, ε- insensitive loss function [11] is considered along with linear kernel to address any potential linear relation among feature space and target values. Basically, we set as 𝜀 = 0.1 defining the distance of boundaries from hyperplane as well as 𝐶 =1 for the penalty ratio.\\n\\n3.4. Deep neural network (NN)\\n\\nFor a given training set {(𝑥1, 𝑦1), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)} ⊂ 𝑋 × 𝑅 , independent variable 𝑋 denotes the space of input and dependent variable 𝑦 denotes output of a network that are connected through a graph shape path with one or more hidden layers and corresponding hidden neurons. Each input neuron that is representative of a feature, carries an initialized weight in which summation of all input neurons and their corresponding weights will be activated on a hidden neuron with the mean of a predefined activation function [12]. Furthermore, the NN will be fed sequentially and its performance will be evaluated in respect of a predefined loss function. Input weight and bias would be updated by first derivation of activation function (i.e., backpropagation) at each sequence till desire termination condition would be achieved. Estimation function of NN is mentioned in 𝐹(𝑋, 𝑊) = 𝜙(𝑊𝑇𝑋) + 𝑏, where 𝑏 is a constant and 𝜙 is corresponding activation function presented as 𝜙(𝑊𝑇𝑋) = 𝜙(∑ (𝑤𝑖 𝑥𝑖) is\\n\\n𝑛 𝑖=1\\n\\n. Normal\\n\\ninitialized weight\\n\\nconsidered for the proposed NN architecture, which is activated by rectifier function; 𝜙(𝑋) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (0, 𝑥𝑖). Finally, adaptive moment (Adam) optimizer is applied to optimize the associated weigh and bias of training set in respect of mean square error (MSE) of prediction and actual value of 𝑦. Two hidden layers are proposed for this study along with feature size and 100 hidden neurons respectively.\\n\\n3.5. Random forest regression (RFR)\\n\\nRandom forest is built based on hierarchical tree-structured predictors in which each tree within forest is trained on a random split of input features [13]. Through the top to dawn path from tree’s root node to splitting nodes and finally to leaves nodes, initially, algorithm uses all input features. These features would be divided at each stage till finally, the best subset of features would be remained on terminal leaves. In this regard, (1) prediction and feature selection are considered at same time. (2) dimensionality of feature space will not affect prediction model. The general RFR formulation and concepts used in this study is based on reviewing literature [13]. For a given training set {(𝑥1, 𝑦1), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛)} ⊂ 𝑋 × 𝑅 , where 𝑋 denotes the space of input features, the estimation function of RFR is: 𝐹(𝑥) = , where 𝑗 is the number of trees in forest and 𝑓𝑗(𝑥) is estimation function of each tree. For a decision tree with 𝑀 splitting nodes, the feature space would be splitting into 𝑀 regions as 𝑅𝑚 in which 𝑓𝑗(𝑥) = ; 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽. A binary decision 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚) ∈ {0,1} is made to outline whether input feature 𝑥 ∑ is selected (i.e., 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅𝑚) or not. In this study, the number of trees is initialized as 1,000 and trees are fully grown which means only one leaf is remained at terminal with selected feature space.\\n\\n1\\n\\n𝐽 𝑗=1\\n\\n∑\\n\\n𝑓𝑗(𝑥)\\n\\n𝐽\\n\\n𝑀 𝑚=1\\n\\n𝑏𝑚 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑅𝑚)\\n\\n4. Experimental results\\n\\nThe coefficient of determination (𝑅2) is employed to measure the fitness of learning algorithm on a training set along with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of prediction models on the testing set. As it is mentioned in section 3.1, three continuous variables are defined as targets, named as Shift 𝑋, Shift 𝑌, and Shift Rotation, in which prediction models are trained on each target separately. RFR uses entire training samples in respect of mean- squared error (MSE) as splitting quality measurement. The best split in RFR is determined by searching all potential splits on each input variable, and the decision tree is fully grown. The accuracy of the prediction models and fitness of learning algorithm are evaluated through 10-fold cross validation to (1) ensure the model is well generalized regarding any independent data set; (2) limit the problem of overfitting. Table 1 presents the average and standard deviation of 10-fold RMSE and R2 for the SVR, NN, and RFR prediction models, respectively.\\n\\nTable 1. performance measurement for SVR, NN, and RFR prediction models; the bolded number represents the outperformed model in terms of both average and standard deviation of 10-fold cross validation.\\n\\nPrediction Model\\n\\nShift 𝑋 (𝜇𝑚)\\n\\nRMSE\\n\\nR2\\n\\nShift 𝑌 (𝜇𝑚)\\n\\nRMSE\\n\\nR2\\n\\nShift Rotation (deg.)

In terms of training fitness (𝑅2), all three models are fitted well for Shift 𝑋 and 𝑌 (see average and standard deviation 𝑅2 for Shift 𝑋 and 𝑌 in Table 1) with above 90% average and zero standard deviation 𝑅2. In respect of shift rotation, NN is fitted with 90% average and 4% standard deviation 𝑅2 while RFR outperforms with 96% average and zero standard deviation of fitness. As a conclusion, RFR is better fitted on training dataset for all three targets. On the other side, to consider overfitting of prediction models, average and standard deviation of RMSE are outlined for testing dataset. However, NN performed better in respect of average RMSE for all three target variables but its highest dispersion around average RMSE makes it unstable comparing with other models. Moreover, RFR provides better performance concerning average and standard deviation RMSE of testing dataset in which predicts passive chip components shift during reflow soldering whit 13.47 (𝜇𝑚), 12.02 (𝜇𝑚), and 1.52 (deg.) error in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational direction for this dataset.\\n\\nTable 2. prediction performance by components type\\n\\nShift X (µm)\\n\\nShift Y (µm)\\n\\nShift Rotation (deg.)\\n\\nSVR\\n\\nNN\\n\\nRFR\\n\\nSVR\\n\\nNN\\n\\nRFR\\n\\nSVR NN RFR\\n\\nC1005\\n\\n19.77\\n\\n16.77\\n\\n14.4\\n\\n20.09\\n\\n18.4\\n\\n17.6\\n\\n0.89\\n\\n0.95\\n\\n0.83\\n\\nR1005\\n\\n22.13\\n\\n20.9\\n\\n19.63\\n\\n15.24\\n\\n11.83\\n\\n11.13\\n\\n1.33\\n\\n1.11\\n\\n1.09\\n\\nC0603\\n\\n14.56\\n\\n11.34\\n\\n12.31\\n\\n12.94\\n\\n9.28\\n\\n9.8\\n\\n1.33\\n\\n1.39\\n\\n1.15\\n\\nR0603\\n\\n12.19\\n\\n10.14\\n\\n11.87\\n\\n10.27\\n\\n7.23\\n\\n7.98\\n\\n1.58\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n1.45\\n\\nC0402\\n\\n10.56\\n\\n6.61\\n\\n7.16\\n\\n13.62\\n\\n8.04\\n\\n12.25\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n1.62\\n\\n2.0\\n\\nR0402\\n\\n10.25\\n\\n10.1\\n\\n9.68\\n\\n10.24\\n\\n8.47\\n\\n9.48\\n\\n1.79\\n\\n1.35\\n\\n1.78\\n\\nIn addition, RMSE for 6 proposed passive chip components are extracted from the testing set, and the performance of the prediction model (RMSE) is outlined for each of them separately presented in Table 2. It is noteworthy that components motion in 𝑥 and 𝑦-directions is sensitive to the size of the component. Along with the increment of component size, the prediction error also increases except for C0402 and R0402 in 𝑦-direction. Moreover, the prediction error is smaller for capacitors in compare with their equivalent resistors except for C0603 and R0603 in 𝑥- direction while in 𝑦-direction, prediction error is higher for the case of capacitors. In terms of rotation, compoents rotate more along with the deduction of component size. Additionally, the shift rotation prediction error is smaller for capacitors in compare with their equivalent resistors except for C0402 and R0402. This can be caused by the effect of components body mass on the components’ rotation.\\n\\nIn the matter of feature selection, the RFR algorithm derived 4, 6, and 35 factors that contributes in shift 𝑋, 𝑌, and rotation respectively. All placement offsets (𝑥, 𝑦, and rotation) appeared to have the most contribution in RFR prediction followed by average volume for shift 𝑋, paste-pad average non-contact area for shift 𝑌, and pre-paste rotation, pre-paste average contact area and so forth for rotational shift. In Fig. 3, prediction model is compared with actual movement value in 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotational directions. As it is shown in Fig. 3 (a), the volume of deposited solder paste affects components shift in 𝑥 direction. Moreover, when solder pastes are well aligned with their corresponding pads (i.e. small paste-pad non-contact area), components would not move dramatically in 𝑦 direction (see Fig. 3 (b)). In respect of rotation, components rotate almost equal with their initial placement rotational offset in reverse direction (see Fig. 3 (c)) to achieve near zero rotational offset after reflow process.\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nFig. 3. prediction vs. actual value of components move in (a) x direction; (b) y direction; (c) rotation; blue triangle presents prediction and pink rectangle presents actual value in data set.\\n\\n5. Conclusion and Future work\\n\\nThis study outlined 48 potential factors that contribute in components movement during reflow soldering and applied machine learning approaches such as SVR, NN, and RFR to predict the amount and direction of components move in 𝑥, 𝑦 and rotational directions. Based on the result, it is outlined that RFR outperforms other techniques in terms of the average predictive losses and their standard deviations across 10-fold cross validation. Indeed, it is\\n\\nnoteworthy that the RFR is well fitted for all 3 targets with the average 𝑅2 of 99%, 99%, and 96% with average prediction errors of 13.47(µ𝑚), 12.02 (µ𝑚), and 1.52 (deg.) for each shift 𝑋, 𝑌, and rotation respectively. Furthermore, solder paste average volume, paste-pad average non-contact area, and placement-paste average contact area are shown to be important in components shift in 𝑥, 𝑦 and rotation respectively. This highlights the importance of solder paste status, relative offset of paste from pad, and relative offset of placement from paste in explaining self-alignment capability of passive chip components.\\n\\nAs a future work, since this study was developed based on the exact value of the component position, defining a standard positional tolerance in respect of component and pad size can enhance the model. Besides, introduced factors at this study can be applied to predict specific defect during reflow soldering such as overhanging, tombstoning, etc. Additionally, the parameters optimization model can be developed to control the best placement location regarding any given solder paste status by the means of the proposed prediction model.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] T.

Furthermore, installing a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) on the target vehicle can provide an extra boost to the reflection of the echo signal, thereby improving the communication quality for in- vehicle users. However, the design of this target-mounted STARS system exhibits significant challenges, such as limited informa- tion sharing and distributed STARS control. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework to tackle the challenges of joint sensing and communication optimization in the considered target-mounted STARS assisted vehicle networks. By deploying agents on both RSU and vehicle, the MADRL framework enables RSU and vehicle to perform beam prediction and STARS pre-configuration using their respective local information. To ensure efficient and stable learning for continuous decision-making, we employ the multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) algorithm and the multi- agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm on the proposed MADRL framework. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed MADRL framework in improving both sensing and communication performance through the utilization of target-mounted STARS. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis and comparison of the two proposed algorithms under various environmental conditions.\\n\\nmutual assistance between sensing and communication (S&C). Through the utilization of shared hardware and spectrum resources, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) ex- ploits coordination gains to achieve better resource manage- ment and improved efficiency of S&C [4].\\n\\nVehicular networks are one of the most important appli- cation scenarios of ISAC. With the leaping development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation, vehicles of the next generation require stronger self-awareness and environmental awareness abilities. ISAC systems allow for large-scale multiview sensing data sharing among vehicles and infrastructure, improving the reliability and efficiency of transportation systems [5]-[8]. Besides, ISAC systems play an important role in sensing-assisted beamforming design for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Specifically, the road side unit (RSU) directly utilizes echo signals reflected by the vehicles to predict beams for data transmission, which avoids high signaling overhead and frequent feedback. In order to achieve more accurate beam prediction, the researchers implement a variety of techniques for processing reflected signals to more precisely detect and track vehicles, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), factor graphs and deep learning (DL) techniques [9]-[11].\\n\\nIndex Terms—Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), sensing-assisted communication, target-mounted simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS), multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), vehicular network.\\n\\nI.

RIS is a meta- surface consisting of massive EM elements, each of which can intelligently adjust the parameters of incident signals [14]. Specifically in vehicular networks, RIS can efficiently combat high path loss in high-frequency bands to enhance V2X con- nectivity and achieve capacity gains through shaping wireless environment [15], [16]. The authors in [17] demonstrated the significant role of RIS in improving the QoS performance of V2I communications. The authors in [18] validated the enhancement of confidentiality in V2X communications by RIS. In [19], the authors conducted an in-depth investiga- tion into RIS-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based vehicular communication networks. However, RIS can only provide services for half-space where both the source and destination nodes lie on the same side of the RIS [20]. To tackle this issue, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS, a.k.a., STAR-RIS) is designed to support reconfiguring the transmitted and reflected signals via trans- mission and reflection coefficients, significantly increasing the\\n\\nin vehicular networks,\\n\\ndegrees of freedom (DoFs) in signal propagation manipulation [21]. On the other hand, the additional DoFs offered by STARS may potentially contribute to balancing the requirements of S&C that are inherently conflicting in ISAC systems.\\n\\nCurrently, research on the STARS (or RIS)-assisted ISAC vehicular networks is in the initial stages. The majority of prior research has been carried out in static scenarios where S&C objectives are distinct [22], [23]. To maximize the role of STARS in 6G-V2X systems, a promising approach is to mount STARS on the surface of target vehicles to improve S&C performance. On the one hand, benefiting from the reflection function of target-mounted STARS, the sensing capabilities of RSUs can be effectively enhanced by increasing the radar cross-section (RCS) of the target vehicle [24]-[26]. On the other hand, despite suffering from high loss when high-frequency signals penetrate the target vehicle, target-mounted STARS have the capability to improve the communication performance of in-vehicle users through the refraction function [27]. More importantly, by appropriately leveraging both the reflection and refraction capabilities of STARS, it has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of sensing-assisted communications, thereby ultimately achieving superior communication quality for the target-mounted STARS vehicular networks [28].\\n\\nThe above-mentioned works are of significant importance for the deployment of target-mounted STARS. However, they have certain limitations. Firstly, the control of target-mounted STARS should be realized in the vehicles rather than the RSU. Prior work [24]-[27] assumed that RSUs control and configure target-mounted STARS, which results in complex transmission protocol designs, lower reliability and security problems. Secondly, in the non-stationary and time-varying environment of 6G-V2X, both the RSU and the vehicle can only observe localized environmental information. Frequent information transmission (especially uplink communication) only designed for sharing information is unrealistic. Further- more, for rapidly changing vehicular network environments, performing high-complexity optimization algorithms such as channel state information (CSI) estimation introduces sig- nificant signaling overhead. In the target-mounted STARS system, the RSU enhances the target sensing performance by relying on STARS reflective capabilities without the need for additional measurements. The research in [27] conducts additional CSI estimation and the research in [28] requires additional vehicle parameters measurement at the RSU when using EKF technology.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach to deal with the challenges in the target-mounted STARS system, which is distinguished by distributed decision-making in a dynamic environment [29]. DRL is considered as a promising method to address physical layer optimization [30], [31], such as modulation, beamform- ing design and channel estimation [32]-[36]. Compared with centralized processing, MADRL can compromise cooperative and competitive trade-offs of agents to achieve a flexible bal- ance in V2I networks [37]-[40]. Incorporating the advantages of MADRL into the target-mounted STARS system can bring two-fold benefits. On the one hand, with the aid of deep\\n\\nneural networks (DNNs), MADRL holds significant potential in processing echo signals for effective beam prediction at the RSU. On the other hand, the deployment of multi-agent enables independent control of target-mounted STARS from the vehicle, which can substantially reduce signaling overhead for information exchange in V2I communications.\\n\\nBased on the analysis above, we propose a MADRL frame- work to achieve S&C optimization for the sensing-assisted communication task. The main contributions of the paper are as follows:\\n\\nWe present the system model and problem formulation for the considered target-mounted STARS-assisted ISAC system, where an RSU communicates with an in-vehicle user with the assistance of sensing signals reflected by the vehicle surface and the target-mounted STARS surface. Our objective is to optimize the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the achievable rate of the in-vehicle user by designing the transmit beamforming and receive filter of the RSU, as well as the reconfiguration of the STARS mounted on the target vehicle. In order to solve this complicated and distributed design problem, the importance of adopting the MADRL framework is discussed and emphasized.\\n\\nNext, we develop an MADRL framework to transform the optimization design problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Based on the historical local-observable information, the RSU agent performs beam prediction while the Car agent configures target-mounted STARS. Compared to existing schemes, our end-to-end MADRL framework does not require complex transmission proto- cols for information sharing and additional measurements such as CSI.\\n\\nFurthermore, to ensure efficient and stable learning for continuous decision-making, we design the multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) algorithm and the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm based on the proposed MADRL framework. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of two MADRL algorithms are provided to illustrate the superior performance compared to deterministic policies.\\n\\nFinally, simulation results prove that MADRL algorithms can significantly enhance S&C performance to realize sensing-assisted communication. Compared with STARS in the refraction-only mode, using STARS to reflect echo signals not only improves radar SNR but also assists communication to the in-vehicle user. The performance improvements in S&C under various environmental con- ditions are also demonstrated.\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sec. II intro- duces the target-mounted STARS-assisted ISAC system. After presenting a MADRL framework in Sec. III, we propose an off-policy MASAC algorithm to optimize S&C performance based on the MADRL framework in Sec. IV. To overcome the limitations of off-policy algorithms, we propose another on- policy MAPPO strategy in Sec. V. Sec. VI provides simulation experiments and the analysis of different algorithms. Finally, we conclude our work in Sec. VII.\\n\\nII. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, we consider a target-mounted STARS- assisted vehicular network, where one RSU communicates with an in-vehicle user with the assistance of STARS lodged on the vehicle surface. Recent research has demonstrated that the ISAC RSU can predict beams based on the echo signals reflected by the vehicles [9]-[11], which avoids additional uplink pilot overhead. Meanwhile, we notice that the STARS can simultaneously reconfigure transmission and reflection links [21]. By employing the target-mounted STARS, on the one hand, the reflected echo signal can be further strength- ened by appropriately adjusting the reflection coefficients of STARS to achieve more accurate beam prediction; on the other hand, by tuning the transmission coefficients of STARS, the transmission signal to the in-vehicle user can also be enhanced to overcome the high loss incurred when penetrating the vehicle. In our considered system, the uniform planar array (UPA) STARS has M elements, and the set of its elements is represented as M = {1, 2, . . . , M }. We suppose that the RSU is equipped with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas, and the in-vehicle user is equipped with a single antenna. We divide the total ISAC service period T into N +1 time slots, each of which has a ∆T duration. The CSI and motion parameters keep constant in the n-th time slot, where ∀n ∈ N = {0, 1, . . . , N } (i.e., ∆T = T\\n\\nN +1 ).\\n\\nA. Channel Model\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, we assume the transmit UPA and the receive UPA of the RSU are placed in the YOZ plane. Let Nt,y and Nt,z be the numbers of transmit antennas along the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. The elevation and azimuth angles of the RSU in the n-th time slot are denoted by φn and ϕn, respectively. Similarly, Nr,y and Nr,z represent the numbers of receive antennas along the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. Therefore, the steering vectors of RSU transmit antennas and receive antennas can be respectively expressed as aR(φn, ϕn) ≜ 1 √ Nt\\n\\n1, . . . , ejπ(cid:0)n1sin(φn)sin(ϕn)+n2cos(φn)(cid:1) (cid:104)\\n\\n,\\n\\n. . . , ejπ(cid:0)Nt,ysin(φn)sin(ϕn)+Nt,zcos(φn)(cid:1)(cid:105)T\\n\\n(1a) 1, . . . , ejπ(cid:0)n3sin(φn)sin(ϕn)+n4cos(φn)(cid:1) (cid:104)\\n\\n,\\n\\nbR(φn, ϕn) ≜ 1 √ Nr\\n\\n,\\n\\n. . . , ejπ(cid:0)Nr,ysin(φn)sin(ϕn)+Nr,zcos(φn)(cid:1)(cid:105)T\\n\\n.\\n\\n(1b)\\n\\nFor the RSU-to-STARS path, the UPA steering vector of the STARS can be expressed as aS(φ∗ n and ϕ∗ n represent the elevation and azimuth angles of the STARS in the n-th time slot with respect to its own coordinate system. We further model it in the standard coordinate system as shown in Fig. 2, where ψn denotes the angle between the vehicle and the x-axis in the n-th time slot. Thus, aS(φ∗ n) can be equivalently written as (cid:104) aS ≜ 1 √ M , . . . , ejπsin(ψn)(cid:0)Mssin(φn)cos(ϕn)+Mssin(φn)sin(ϕn)(cid:1)(cid:105)T\\n\\nn, ϕ∗\\n\\nn), where φ∗\\n\\nn, ϕ∗\\n\\n1, . . . , ejπsin(ψn)(cid:0)m1sin(φn)cos(ϕn)+m2sin(φn)sin(ϕn)(cid:1)\\n\\n, (2)\\n\\nFig. 1.

Thus the steering vector of STARS can be given as aS(φ∗ 0). Therefore, the STARS-to-user channel h0 ∈ CM ×1, the downlink RSU-to-STARS channel ∈ CM ×Nt and the uplink STARS-to-RSU channel GDL n n ∈ CM ×Nr in the n-th time slot can be given as GUL M NtαnaS(φ∗ M NrαnaS(φ∗ 0, ϕ∗ M α0aS(φ∗\\n\\n0, ϕ∗\\n\\n(cid:112)\\n\\nGDL GUL\\n\\nn, ϕ∗ n, ϕ∗ 0),\\n\\nn)aH n)bH\\n\\nn = n = h0 =\\n\\nR (φn, ϕn), R (φn, ϕn),\\n\\n(cid:112)\\n\\n(cid:112)\\n\\n(3a)\\n\\n(3b)\\n\\n(3c)\\n\\nwhere the pass-loss coefficient α is modeled as α(d) = α0( d )ζ, a0 denotes the signal attenuation at the reference d0 distance d0 and ζ is the pass loss exponent.\\n\\nB. Target-Mounted STARS Model\\n\\nSTARS can simultaneously adjust the reflected signal and the transmitted signal by reconfiguring the EM property of each element. The transmission splitting ratio and the re- flection splitting ratio of the m-th STARS element in the n-th time slot are written as βT n,m, respectively, where (βT n,m)2 = 1 and βT n,m)2 + (βR n,m ∈ [0, 1], ∀n ∈ N , ∀m ∈ M. Furthermore, the transmission phase- shift and reflection phase-shift of the m-th element in the n-th time slot are denoted as θT n,m, respectively. We denote F and B as the feasible phase-shift set and the phase-shift resolution to ensure θT n,m ∈ F, where 2B , . . . , 2π×(2B −1) F ≜ {0, 2π }. Accordingly, the matrices of\\n\\nn,m and βR\\n\\nn,m, βR\\n\\nn,m and θR\\n\\nn,m, θR\\n\\n2B\\n\\nthe STARS transmission coefficients and reflection coefficients can be respectively expressed as\\n\\nΘT n ΘR n\\n\\n≜ diag (cid:8)βT ≜ diag (cid:8)βR\\n\\nn,M (cid:9), (4a) n,M (cid:9).

Sensing Model\\n\\nWe denote sn(t) as the ISAC signal transmitted by the RSU in the n-th time slot. As shown in Fig. 1, the echo signal at the RSU consists of two components: One part is the signal reflected via the vehicle surface, and the other part is the signal reflected through the STARS surface using its reflection functionality. We denote transmit beamforming vector and receive beamforming/filtering in the n-th time slot n ∈ CNr×1, respectively. The echo n ∈ CNt×1 and wr as wt signal at the RSU is expressed as\\n\\nrn(t) =ej2πµnt(cid:104)\\n\\nGβαnbR(φn, ϕn)aH (cid:124)\\n\\nR (φn, ϕn) (cid:125)\\n\\n(cid:123)(cid:122) Car surface reflection\\n\\nn GDL n )H ΘR + (GUL n (cid:124) (cid:125) (cid:123)(cid:122) STARS surface reflection\\n\\n(cid:105) wt\\n\\nnsn(t − νn) + zn(t),\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n√\\n\\nwhere G = NtNr is the total antenna array gain, β ∼ CN (0, σ2 R) represents the RCS of the vehicle surface, νn and µn are the time delay and Doppler frequency in the n-th time slot, respectively, which can be estimated by the matched- filtering method.\\n\\nWe use the matched filter to process the echo signal. Let ∆t denote the duration of one symbol and η = ∆T ∆t denote the total number of symbols processed by the matched filter in each time slot. Thus, the output signal after processing η symbols by the matched filter in the n-th time slot can be given by [9]\\n\\nrn =\\n\\n√\\n\\nη\\n\\n(cid:104)\\n\\nGβαnbR(φn, ϕn)aH\\n\\nR (φn, ϕn)\\n\\n+(GUL\\n\\nn )H ΘR\\n\\nn GDL n\\n\\n(cid:105)\\n\\nwt\\n\\nn + zn,\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere η also denotes the matched-filtering gain, zn ∼ CN (0, σ2 s INr ) is the measurement noise.

Communication Model\\n\\nThe target-mounted STARS is also employed to assist the wireless communication between the RSU and the in-vehicle user. We assume that the direct line-of-sight (LoS) path does not exist due to high penetration loss when passing through the\\n\\nvehicle. With the assistance of the STARS, the receive signal at the in-vehicle user is given by\\n\\nyn(t) =ej2πµnthH\\n\\n0 ΘT\\n\\nn GDL\\n\\nn wt\\n\\nnsn(t) + χn(t),\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nwhere χn(t) ∼ CN (0, σ2 c ) denotes the transmission noise.

Besides, with the assistance of wr n at the RSU and ΘR n at the target-mounted STARS, better sensing performance can provide more accurate beam prediction which can further enhance the communication performance.\\n\\nn at the RSU and ΘT\\n\\nE. Problem Formulation\\n\\nWe aim to jointly enhance S&C performance to realize sensing-assisted communication with the assistance of the target-mounted STARS, where sensing performance is de- scribed by radar SNR γRSU and communication performance is measured by the achievable rate Rn. Since STARS should be directly controlled by the vehicle, the RSU and the vehicle maintain minimal information sharing to design beamforming and configure STARS, respectively. This multi-objective joint optimization problem is formulated as\\n\\nn\\n\\n(γRSU n\\n\\nmax n,wr n,ΘR s.t.\\n\\n, Rn)\\n\\n(11a)\\n\\nwt\\n\\nn ,ΘT n,m, θR θT n,m, βR βT n,m)2 + (βR (βT n∥2 ≤ P, ∀n ∈ N , ∥wt γRSU n ≥ γRSU n ≥ γUser γUser\\n\\nn\\n\\nn,m ∈ F, ∀n ∈ N , m ∈ M, n,m ∈ [0, 1], ∀n ∈ N , m ∈ M,\\n\\n(11b)\\n\\n(11c) n,m)2 = 1, ∀n ∈ N , m ∈ M, (11d) (11e)\\n\\nmin , ∀n ∈ N , min , ∀n ∈ N ,\\n\\n(11f)\\n\\n(11g)\\n\\nwhere (11b)-(11d) are the phase-shift constraints and the energy splitting constraint of STARS, respectively. (11e) is the transmit power constraint and P is the maximum transmit power at the RSU. γRSU min and γUser min respectively denote the minimum received radar SNR and the minimum transmission SNR, which are used to ensure suitable S&C performance during the ISAC service.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an end-to-end MADRL framework where two agents are respectively placed in the RSU and the vehicle (named as RSU/Car agent) for independent decision- making. Specifically, to minimize signaling overhead [9], the RSU agent performs beam prediction while the Car agent pre-configures STARS to prepare for the ISAC service at the beginning of each time slot. In the following, we briefly explain the advantages of using MADRL framework compared with traditional algorithms in the target-mounted STARS ISAC system, as outlined below.\\n\\n• Less-observable real-time environmental information: In dynamic vehicular networks, obtaining real-time envi-\\n\\nronmental information (such as CSI) is extremely difficult for conducting effective beam prediction and STARS pre-configuration [12]. Fortunately, MADRL is well- suited for tackling prediction problems based on the MDP framework [30], which allows agents to extract features from historical observable information through deep neural networks (DNNs).\\n\\nIncomplete and unshared status\\n\\ninformation: To avoid frequent information sharing and significant pilot overhead, the RSU agent and the Car agent should perform beam prediction and STARS pre-configuration based on local environmental information, respectively. In MADRL approaches, each agent makes independent decisions by partial observation [29].\\n\\nMulti-objective optimization: We aim to improve S&C performance to ultimately achieve better sensing-assisted communication for the in-vehicle user. However, trade- offs of multi-objectives in traditional optimization are static and rigid [31]. To tackle this issue, MADRL allows for cooperation and competition among multiple agents [29]. Moreover, MADRL enables individual agents to make decisions for multiple objectives by designing its reward function.\\n\\nContinuous decision-making: Each agent is required to maintain ISAC services throughout N + 1 time slots. Unlike DL which relies on the extraction of features from vast static datasets, the fundamental nature of MADRL is updating policies dynamically through trial and error, whereas the MDP framework enables a continuous se- quence of decision-making. Besides, MADRL can ef- fectively tackle multi-step interaction problems by using lightweight networks.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, MADRL demonstrates tremen- dous potential in realizing sensing-assisted communication for the target-mounted STARS vehicular network. In the next section, we will provide a generalized introduction to the proposed MADRL framework.\\n\\nIII. MADRL FRAMEWORK\\n\\nIn this section, we first present the multi-agent MDP struc- ture for solving the considered problem (11). Then, we design the key elements of MDP while considering the challenges in the target-mounted STARS system. Finally, we propose the end-to-end MADRL framework.\\n\\nA. MDP Structure in Target-Mounted STARS Network\\n\\nThe MDP structure provides a universal mathematical model for DRL and serves as a guiding principle for the design of most DRL algorithms. Assuming that the future state depends only on the previous state, the important parameters of DRL can be represented by tuple (S, A, π, R, ξ, P), in which S represents the state of the agent itself and the observed environment information. A and π represent the action taken based on the current state information and the policy for taking an action, respectively, which usually have connections in different DRL algorithms. R represents the reward based on the actions the agent has performed, which\\n\\nFig. 3. The MADRL framework for STARS-assisted vehicular network.\\n\\nthe target-mounted\\n\\ncan be designed freely. The constant discount factor ξ is used to balance the current reward with the future reward. Lastly, the agent proceeds to the next state S ′ based on the transition probabilities P and repeats the aforementioned process.\\n\\nWe further introduce the multi-agent MDP structure in the target-mounted STARS system, where the RSU provides continuous ISAC services in total N + 1 time slots for the in-vehicle user. From the DRL aspect, we consider the driving trajectory of the vehicle beginning from the starting point as one MADRL episode, with a maximum of N + 1 DRL time steps. In the n-th time slot, the transitions of two agents are denoted as T R n , rR n−1, aR n , dn) and n = (sC T C n , dn), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, at the beginning of the n-th time slot, both the RSU agent and the Car agent make decisions based on their respective observed previous states from the last time slot in the par- tially observable environment (sR n−1), and generates n and aC corresponding actions (aR n ). Subsequently, the RSU communicates with the in-vehicle user and receives the echo signals reflected by the vehicle. At the same time, two agents interact with the real-time environment, observe the current n ) and receive rewards (rR states information (sR n and rC n ). Finally, agents utilize the observable information to determine whether the current episode is done (dn) or proceed to the next time step. Throughout the iterative process, the agents store transitions for each time slot into the transitions buffer, which is used to periodically train agents to update better policies.\\n\\nn = (sR\\n\\nn , sR\\n\\nn−1, aC\\n\\nn , rC\\n\\nn , sC\\n\\nn−1 and sC\\n\\nn and sC\\n\\nB. Configuration of Key Elements in MDP Structure\\n\\nNext, we provide detailed descriptions of each key transition element in the MDP structure in the target-mounted STARS system. It is important to emphasize that elements are designed using the partial environment information obtained by each agent. Meanwhile, in the high-speed and dynamic vehicular network, observing adequate environment information and obtaining accurate data such as CSI are challenging. The above issues undoubtedly pose challenges to our design. In order to maximize the acquisition of environmental information and achieve efficient learning, we design each key parameter as follows.\\n\\n• State: The RSU agent can extract partial environment information by receiving signals processed by matched\\n\\nfiltering. According to (6), the state of the RSU agent in the n-th time slot sR\\n\\nn can be expressed as n = (cid:8)ℜ(rn)T , ℑ(rn)T (cid:9), sR where ℜ(·) and ℑ(·) represent the real and imaginary parts, respectively, which integrate the state into the input format for the DNN. The dimension of sR n is 2Nr. For the state of the Car agent, considering the available environmental information at the vehicle end, sC n can be expressed as\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nn = (cid:8)vn, γUser sC where vn represents the velocity of the vehicle in the n-th time slot. We ensure that sC n can be efficiently obtained by interacting with the local real-time environment. • Action: The output actions represent the decisions made by two agents. Specifically, the RSU agent designs the transmit beamforming and the receive filter while the Car agent configures the target-mounted STARS, which can be further described as follows:\\n\\n(cid:9),\\n\\nn\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nn = (cid:8)ℜ(wt aR n = (cid:8)θR n,1, ..., θR aC n,1, ..., βR βR\\n\\nn)T (cid:9), n,m, ...θT\\n\\nn)T , ℜ(wr\\n\\nn)T , ℑ(wr n)T , ℑ(wt n,M , θT n,1, ..., θT (cid:9).\\n\\n(14a)\\n\\nn,m, ...θR n,m, ...βR\\n\\nn,M ,\\n\\n(14b)\\n\\nn,M\\n\\nThe actions output by agents need further processing to satisfy the variable constraints of the considered problem. Specifically, the RSU agent processes aR n to satisfy con- straint (11e), while the Car agent processes aC n to satisfy constraints (11b) and (11c). Meanwhile, the coefficient βT n,m is calculated according to constraint (11d). The dimensions of the actions are 2(Nt + Nr) and 3M , respectively.\\n\\nReward: Similar to the state, the reward function must be designed using observable environmental information. For the RSU agent, we define the reward in the n-th time slot as (15)\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the feedback from the Car agent via the uplink communication is not practical due to significant additional signaling overhead. Moreover, we design reward function f (·) to prevent DRL agents from becoming insensitive to small rewards, which may lead to negative learning guidance. At the same time, we define the reward function for the Car agent as\\n\\nn = ωf (γCar rC\\n\\nn ) + f (γUser\\n\\nn\\n\\n),\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nwhere ω is a weight factor the Car agent uses to balance S&C performance more flexibly. For the Car agent, γUser can be easily obtained by calculating the power of its received signals.\\n\\nn\\n\\nDone: At any time slot, both the RSU agent and the Car agent must satisfy the minimum S&C performance (i.e., constraints (11f) and (11g)). Moreover, if the ISAC service attains the maximum N +1 time slots, the ongoing episode comes to an end. Thus, we define an indicator dn to determine whether the episode terminates or not,\\n\\nAlgorithm 1 Proposed MADRL framework\\n\\n1: Initialize the RSU agent and the Car agent. 2: Initialize the transitions buffer. 3: for each episode e do 4: 5:\\n\\nfor each time slot n = 0, 1, ..., N do\\n\\nFor each agent i ∈ {R, C}, make action ai the DNN network by inputting si Finish the ISAC process in the n-th time slot.

Proposed MADRL Framework\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, as shown in Algorithm 1, we propose the end-to-end MADRL framework where the S&C optimization of the target-mounted STARS system can be converted into the MDP problem. We provide a detailed explanation of the proposed framework as follows.\\n\\nWe initiate a new episode when n = 0 and each episode contains consecutive ISAC services with N + 1 time slots. At the beginning of the n-th time steps, the RSU agent and the Car agent respectively predict corresponding beamforming n and STARS pre-configuration aC aR n based on the previous state si n−1 as step 51. Then, two agents conduct ISAC service and observe respective local environmental information si n as steps 6-7. Steps 8-19 outline the iterative decision optimization process for agents. In step 9, each agent can obtain reward ri n based on ai n to evaluate current behavior2. In step 10, each agent stores the transition of the n-th time slot in the transitions buffer. For the buffer capable of accommodating Tmax transitions, the transitions of each agent are managed and stored in sequential order, denoted as\\n\\nn and si\\n\\nTn = (T R\\n\\nn , T C\\n\\nn ) = (sn−1, an, rn, sn, dn).\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nSteps 12-14 represent the training procedure to optimize policy for different MADRL algorithms.

Particularly, step 12 is designed to ensure periodic training intervals to overcome the challenge of allocating adequate computational resources for training agents in every time slot. In our proposed MADRL framework, the training interval is determined based on whether the algorithm is on-policy or off-policy.\\n\\nIn summary, we introduce a comprehensive MADRL frame- work for enhancing S&C performance in target-mounted STARS-assisted vehicular networks. The framework ensures the seamless integration of various algorithms into our uni- versal framework (in steps 12-16). In the following sections, we present two highly efficient MADRL training algorithms designed to update the policy of each agent.\\n\\nIV. PROPOSED OFF-POLICY MASAC ALGORITHM\\n\\nIn this section, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the training process for the off-policy MASAC algorithm. In off-policy strategies, a clear distinction arises between the target policy and the behavior policy, which allows agents to gain insights from an array of historical policies. Off-policy strategies exhibit distinctive characteristics by effectively uti- lizing all past transitions while simultaneously achieving a harmonious equilibrium between exploitation and exploration. The MASAC algorithm can be considered a prime example of off-policy algorithms. Compared with other off-policy de- terministic algorithms, MASAC distinguishes itself by intro- ducing the concept of maximum entropy, which facilitates exploration while simultaneously preventing the algorithm from converging to suboptimal solutions. In the STARS- assisted vehicular network environment, the deployment of MASAC effectively reduces the overhead and training costs associated with agent-environment interactions. This benefit is accomplished by encouraging exploration and is more probable to offer substantial S&C performance improvements. We first introduce the architecture of MASAC. For each i ∈ {R, C} in the MASAC algorithm, we employ agent the actor-critic (AC) framework, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The\\n\\nAC networks are denoted as πθi (ai (sj−1, aj), j−1) and Qϕi respectively, with θi and ϕi l representing the DNN weight the critic parameters. To tackle the over-estimation issue, network employs two Q-functions (i.e., l = 1, 2), to provide more precise estimations of Q-values. Simultaneously, in order to further enhance the stability of learning, the target network Qϕi (sj−1, aj) is adopted for the critic. We set the training interval to Et episodes to alleviate deployment complexity (i.e., step 13 of Algorithm 1). The transitions buffer in the off-policy approach collects all transitions generated during the interaction process. Each agent randomly selects Tbatch transitions from the transitions buffer for training.\\n\\nj|si\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nSubsequently, we elaborate on the network update process during the training phase of the MASAC algorithm. The primary goal of the SAC is to optimize policy entropy by identifying the highest possible reward. The basic framework of the SAC algorithm can be established through the following derived set of equations:\\n\\nV (S) = E A∼π Q(S, A) = E\\n\\n(cid:104)\\n\\nQ(S, A) + αH(cid:0)π(·|S)(cid:1)(cid:105) (cid:2)R + ξV (S ′)(cid:3),\\n\\n,\\n\\nS ′∼P\\n\\nπ = arg min\\n\\nπ\\n\\nDKL\\n\\n(cid:104)\\n\\nπ(A | S)∥\\n\\nexp (cid:0) 1\\n\\nα Q(S, A)(cid:1) Z(S)\\n\\n(19a)\\n\\n(19b)\\n\\n(cid:105)\\n\\n,\\n\\n(19c)\\n\\nwhere H(cid:0)π(·|S)(cid:1) = − E log π(A|S) denotes the entropy of policy π, and α is the temperature coefficient. The expression for the soft value function, including the entropy term, is given by (19a). The soft Bellman equation (19b) comprehensively evaluates policies by combining entropy with the value func- tion corresponding to the next state. Equation (19c) minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to seek a new updated policy that not only aims to achieve greater value but also maintains higher entropy. Z(S) is the normalized distribution function.\\n\\nA∼π\\n\\nNext, we introduce the MASAC algorithm in the target- mounted STARS-assisted vehicular network. For each agent, the update to critic networks is achieved by minimizing the soft Bellman residual. We define the set of Tbatch managed transitions (18) used for training as D. The loss function for the critic can be written as\\n\\nL(ϕi\\n\\nl) = E\\n\\nTj ∼D\\n\\n(cid:104)(cid:0)Qϕi\\n\\nl\\n\\n(sj−1, aj) − yi(cid:1)2(cid:105)\\n\\n,\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nwhere yi is the target soft value of each agent, which is denoted according to (19a) and (19b) as:\\n\\nj)(cid:1), (21) where dj = 1 − dj. It is important to emphasize that (cid:101)ai j is not ai j stored in transitions, but rather an action sampled from the probability distribution of the policy based on the output of the actor network, denoted as (cid:101)ai j ∼ π(·|sj−1). From equation (19c), we can derive the loss function for each actor as:\\n\\n(cid:0) min\\n\\nyi = ri\\n\\n(sj, (cid:101)aj+1) − αi log πθi ((cid:101)ai\\n\\nj+1|si\\n\\nj + ξdj\\n\\nQϕi\\n\\nl=1,2\\n\\nl\\n\\nL(θi) = E\\n\\nTj ∼D\\n\\n(cid:2)αi log πθi ((cid:101)ai\\n\\nj|si\\n\\nj−1) − min l=1,2\\n\\nQϕi\\n\\nl\\n\\n(sj−1, (cid:101)aj)(cid:3).

III. The findings from the simulation results provide ev- idence that the MASAC algorithm presents notable benefits as compared to other deterministic strategies. Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge that off-policy strategies exhibit certain limitations due to their training methodologies [30]. The off-policy algorithms utilize all past transitions to ensure comprehensive learning. However, it will lead to decreased learning efficiency and slow convergence. Besides, the learning process of the off-policy strategy is unstable as it may exploit poor transitions. Furthermore, the practical implementation of off-policy algorithms is hindered by their sensitivity to parameters. Considering these potential drawbacks of applying the MASAC algorithm in the target-mounted STARS vehicular network, we present an on-policy approach in the next section.\\n\\nV. PROPOSED ON-POLICY MAPPO ALGORITHM\\n\\nIn this section, we propose to deploy an on-policy MAPPO algorithm, which can maintain both effective exploration and stable learning capabilities, in the MADRL framework intro- duced in Sec. III. The MAPPO algorithm successfully tackles the convergence difficulties encountered by traditional policy gradient (PG) algorithms. In our environment setup, as illus- trated in Fig. 5, the transitions buffer stores Tmax transitions generated from the interactions between the current policy and the environment, and all of these transitions are utilized for\\n\\n(23)\\n\\n(24a)\\n\\n(24b)\\n\\n(24c)\\n\\n(25)\\n\\nFig. 5.

To mitigate gradient variance and enhance stability, we adopt a strategy of dividing all transitions D into DK distinct mini-batches during each learning process. Once the learning process is complete, the transitions buffer is cleared to prepare for storing transitions from the new policy. Moreover, to ensure an accurate estimation of the latest policy, target networks are not employed. For each agent, the AC networks are represented by πθi (ai j−1) and Vϕi (sj−1), respectively.\\n\\nj|si\\n\\nSubsequently, we provide a detailed explanation of imple- menting the MAPPO algorithm in the target-mounted STARS- assisted vehicular network. MAPPO is a policy optimization algorithm. Specifically, the old policy and the new policy are denoted as πo θi and πn θi , respectively. The theoretical objective can be expressed as: θi((cid:101)ai (cid:2) πn θi(ai πo θi ((cid:101)ai (cid:2) πn θi (ai πo\\n\\nj | si j | si j | si j | si\\n\\nj−1) j−1) j−1) j−1)\\n\\nj−1)(cid:3),\\n\\nE Tj ∼Dk\\n\\nA(ai\\n\\nj, si\\n\\nmax θi\\n\\n− 1(cid:3) ≤ ϵ, ∀k, ∀j, ∀i,\\n\\nE Tj ∼Dk\\n\\ns.t.\\n\\nwhere constraint (26b) serves the purpose of limiting the disparity between the new and old policies to a reasonable extent, while also ensuring that the new policy remains fea- sible.

As de- picted in Fig. 6, we consider a target-mounted STARS-assisted vehicular network, where the RSU is located at (-50m, 0, 30m) and serves the vehicle moving along the curve road with vary- ing speeds. The deployment altitude of the STARS is set at 2m. The path-loss exponents of the RSU-STARS and STARS-user channels are set to 2.5 and 2.8, respectively. The environmental information at the start point (i.e., n = 0 at (10m,50m,0)) is known. For each agent, si −1 is obtained under the conditions of θR −1,m)2 = 0.5. The minimum SNR to ensure satisfactory S&C performance is set as γRSU min = γUser min = 10dB. Other default environment parameters are listed in Table I.\\n\\n−1,m = θT\\n\\n−1,m = 0 and (βR\\n\\n−1,m)2 = (βT\\n\\nWe first verify the convergence performance of MASAC and MAPPO algorithms within the proposed MADRL framework. Here, we denote Gi = (cid:80)N n=0 ri n as the cumulative reward (total return) accumulated by each agent during interactions with the environment. In an effort to clearly evaluate conver- gence performance, we calculate the average return over all episodes. For the e-th episode, the average episode return is i e = 1 e Gi. Fig. 7 illustrates the convergence denoted as G e performance of two algorithms under default environmental parameters, with the hyperparameters for each algorithm listed in Table I. It can be observed that both algorithms achieve stable convergence performance within our proposed MADRL framework. Additionally, the proposed MADRL framework excels in learning under limited environmental information by effectively extracting meaningful features from the local- observable environment.\\n\\n(cid:80)\\n\\nAlgorithm 3 outlines the training process of MAPPO. From the perspective of DNN structures, it is clear that the MAPPO agents are more lightweight without critic networks compared to the on-policy MASAC algorithm. Meanwhile, MAPPO realizes a significant reduction in the storage requirements for the transitions buffer, which only needs to save transitions generated by the current policy. However, on-policy algorithms have limitations, such as converging to the local optima. In the next section, we present simulations to compare the performance of two proposed MADRL algorithms in the\\n\\nWe delve further into analyzing the convergence of S&C performance in each slot, focusing on three selected time slots RSU = (n = 0, 5, 10). We utilize average episode SNR γn 1 , as metrics to evaluate e the convergence of S&C performance, respectively. Fig. 8 presents the convergence results, demonstrating that the radar SNR for the RSU and the communication SNR for the in- vehicle user are significantly improved and can exceed γRSU min and γUser min through consistently learning.

For comparison purposes, we also deploy MADDPG [41] and MATD3 [42] algorithms within the proposed MADRL framework. Additionally, we compare the scenario where STARS is used only in the refraction mode (referred to as“ w/o reflection”), where the signals are solely reflected by the vehicle body back to the RSU and propagate through STARS to the in-vehicle user. To facili- tate a direct performance comparison, we employ (cid:101)γRSU = (cid:80)N 1 n=0 γRSU to evaluate the overall sensing performance n N (cid:80)N and (cid:101)R = 1 n=0 Rn to evaluate the overall communication N performance. Figs. 9 and 10 respectively illustrate the S&C performance versus the number of STARS elements. Firstly, when STARS is in the w/o reflection mode, the performance differences among the deployed algorithms are not very pronounced. However, enhancing reflection through STARS significantly improves sensing performance of 150% − 350%,\\n\\n4681012141618Average Radar SNR (dB)\\n\\n2536496481100Number of STARS elements, M\\n\\nw/ reflection, MADDPG\\n\\nw/ reflection, MAPPO\\n\\nw/o reflection,, MASAC\\n\\nw/o reflection., MAPPO\\n\\nw/ reflection, MASAC\\n\\nw/o reflection, MADDPG\\n\\nw/o reflection, MATD3\\n\\nw/ reflection, MATD3\\n\\nFig. 9.

It demonstrates the feasibility and impor- tance of jointly improving S&C to realize superior sensing- assisted communication in target-mounted STARS systems. Secondly, as the number of STARS elements increases, both S&C performance improves significantly when STARS is in the “w/ reflection” mode. Furthermore, two proposed MADRL algorithms demonstrate more significant performance en- hancements than the deterministic policies (MADDPG and MATD3), where the poor exploration capabilities make it challenging to reach optimal solutions. Finally, it can be seen that our proposed MADRL framework enables agents to achieve the trade-off between S&C and the equilibrium cooperation and competition between agents for all algorithms. Figs. 11 and 12 display the S&C performance for different the RSU transmit antennas and receive antennas. Firstly, simulation results illustrate that both agents can maintain ap- propriate decisions under various output dimensions of DNNs, demonstrating the stability of the proposed MDP structure within the MADRL framework.

In Fig. 12(a), it is noticed that an increased number of re- ceive antennas enhances sensing performance owing to better receive filtering ability. The improved communication perfor- mance shown in Fig. 12(b) also demonstrates the effective sensing-assisted communication scheme in the target-mounted STARS system. Moreover, the two proposed algorithms still perform better than competitors of deterministic strategies.\\n\\nthe MASAC algorithm outperforms the MAPPO algorithm in most cases. This is because the off-policy strategy of MASAC ensures the full utilization of all historical experiences. At the same time, the on-policy MAPPO learns from data consistently using the cur- rent policy, resulting in lower data utilization and insufficient exploration. However, we should emphasize that the thorough exploration of off-policy algorithms often comes at the cost of increased interaction and learning overhead. In particular, MASAC requires more extensive learning interactions com-\\n\\nWe notice from Figs. 9-12 that\\n\\n104\\n\\n02468101214Average Episodes at Convergence\\n\\nSTARS elements, MReceive antennas, NrTransmit antennas, Nt\\n\\nMAPPOMASACMATD3MADDPG\\n\\nFig. 13.

To verify this fact, Fig. 13 illustrates the average number of episodes required to converge four algorithms under various scenarios. These simulation results indicate that the on-policy MAPPO algorithm can rapidly adapt to unknown environments and requires a fewer number of episodes to achieve convergence. In contrast, although the incorporation of entropy in MASAC has been shown to enhance exploration capability and learning efficiency, it remains necessary for MASAC to learn extensive knowledge from historical experiences.\\n\\nFig. 14 illustrates the S&C performance under different transmit power P with M = 64, Nt = Nr = 36. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can attain consistent S&C gain despite varying degrees of trade-offs induced by different powers. Moreover, even in challenging scenarios with low power levels, our two proposed algorithms can effectively improve S&C performance by employing ap- propriate reward functions (15) and (16). It is worth noting that MAPPO adopts the default hyperparameters as shown in TABLE I for different power levels, while the performance\\n\\n100-50050100150200250300350400Average Episode Return 105\\n\\n105\\n\\n00.511.52Episode\\n\\n100-50050100150200250300350400450Average Episode Return 105\\n\\n(a) Off-policy MASAC Algorithm.\\n\\n(b) On-policy MAPPO Algorithm.\\n\\nFig. 15.

The simulation results reveal that the on- policy MAPPO algorithm maintains stable performance across a certain range of hyperparameter variations, consistently exhibiting superior performance. In contrast, the off-policy MASAC algorithm is highly sensitive to the specified hyperpa- rameters. The instability of MASAC undoubtedly increases the deployment difficulty in real-world environments, as careful tuning of hyperparameters is required for different scenarios. With its strong stability and robustness in various complex environments, MAPPO demonstrates a greater suitability for the target-mounted STARS vehicle network.\\n\\nFig. 16 illustrates the performance of two algorithms under\\n\\n100-50050100150200250300350400Average Episode Return Car agent, 6FCs\\n\\n105\\n\\n00.511.52Episode\\n\\n100-50050100150200250300350400450Average Episode Return 105\\n\\n(a) Off-policy MASAC Algorithm.\\n\\n(b) On-policy MAPPO Algorithm.\\n\\nFig. 17.

The simulation results demonstrate that both algorithms can effectively facilitate agent learning in environments with dif- ferent vehicle speeds, even in scenarios with unknown road conditions and CSI. This result highlights the effectiveness of MADRL algorithms in tackling complex problems when agents have access to limited local information.\\n\\nFinally, we compare the impact of the DNN architecture employed by agents. To ensure a fair comparison, each agent consists of fully connected layers (FCs) with 200- width of each hidden layer. Fig. 17 illustrates the convergence performance of the two algorithms with different numbers of FCs deployed in the actor/critic network, which demon- strates that we can employ lightweight networks (3-4 FCs) to realize S&C optimization, further verifying the significant advantage of MADRL in tackling continuous decision-making tasks. Moreover, the issue of overfitting caused by gradient invariance becomes severe in MASAC as FCs deepen. In contrast, MAPPO maintains stable performance for networks with different layers and exhibits better overall robustness.\\n\\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nIn this paper, we proposed an end-to-end MADRL frame- work for simultaneously enhancing S&C performance in the target-mounted STARS-assisted ISAC system. A joint design problem was formulated in order to optimize the transmit beamforming and receive filter at the RSU agent, as well as the configuration matrices of STARS at the Car agent. The simulation results demonstrated that utilizing target-mounted STARS can notably improve the achievable transmission rate for the in-vehicle user. This improvement is achieved not only by utilizing STARS’ refraction property to create a favorable transmission link, but also by using its reflection ability to enhance the echo at RSU, which in turn enhances the radar SNR and enables more accurate beamforming pre- diction for transmission. Moreover, we compared and analyzed the robustness and performance of the proposed MASAC and MAPPO algorithms, revealing their advantages compared\\n\\nwith deterministic strategies. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the important role of STARS on the target vehicle and the proposed MADRL algorithm in enhancing sensing- assisted communications for vehicle networks.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n[1] F.

Combined with three-dimensional point cloud data processing and assembly position matching algorithm, the high-precision measurement of shaft hole assembly posture in the process of turbine shaft docking is realized. Firstly, the screw thread curve on the bolt surface is segmented based on PCA projection and edge point cloud clustering, and Hough transform is used to model ﬁt the three-dimensional thread curve. Then the preprocessed two-dimensional convex hull is constructed to segment the key hole location features, and the mounting surface and hole location obtained by segmentation are ﬁtted based on RANSAC method. Finally, the geometric feature matching is used the evaluation index of turbine shaft assembly is established to optimize the pose. The ﬁnal measurement accuracy of mounting surface matching is less than 0.05mm, and the measurement accuracy of mounting hole matching based on minimum ance optimization is less than 0.1 degree. The measurement algorithm is implemented on the automatic assembly test-bed of a certain type of aero-engine low-pressure turbine rotor. In the narrow installation space, the assembly process of the turbine shaft assembly, such as the automatic alignment and docking of the shaft hole, the automatic heating and temperature measurement of the installation seam, and the automatic tightening of the two guns, are realized in the narrow installation space Guidance, real-time inspection and assembly result evaluation.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn the complex structure of aero-engine, there are a lot of assembly joint surfaces with bolt fastening connec- tion, such as engine casing, rotor disc, turbine shaft, etc It is easy to bump or even block in the process of matching. At the same time, the low-pressure turbine shaft surface coating can not install the target, and the ﬁeld light source environment is more complex. Based on the above considerations, the measurement scheme based on structured light binocular is adopted, and the current assembly pose is calculated based on 3D point cloud data.\\n\\ning.

Because of the high-precision non- contact measurement system, the automatic assem- bly process of aero-engine low-pressure turbine shaft based on three-dimensional vision is initially estab- lished. The key parameters in the measurement al- gorithm are optimized in the process of engineering application, which improves the assembly power and assembly eﬃciency of the system[7]. In particular, the speciﬁc algorithm ﬂow of 3D thread curve segmenta- tion and extraction modeling for assembly bolt surface is proposed, which solves the measurement problems of hole alignment matching and tightening gun tighten- ing alignment[9], and establishes the evaluation index of assembly surface matching and hole position align- ment matching to optimize measurement, which has\\n\\n5\\n\\nuniversality for solving such engineering problems[10].\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Barr and O.

Commonly composed of a number of reconﬁgurable passive cell components and basic electronic circuits, RISs can almost freely perform a set of wave modiﬁcation functionalities, in order to realize programmable wireless environments (PWEs). However, a more energy-efﬁcient way to realize a PWE is through dynamically relocating static metasurfaces that perform a unique functionality. In this paper, we employ a UAV swarm to dynamically deploy a set of low- cost passive metasurfaces that are able to perform only one electromagnetic functionality, but with the beneﬁt of requiring no power. Speciﬁcally, the UAV-mounted static metasurfaces are carefully positioned across the sky to create cascaded channels for improved user service and security hardening. The perfor- mance evaluation results, based on ray tracing, demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.\\n\\nIndex Terms—Wireless propagation, UAVs, Metasurfaces, RIS,\\n\\ncost and energy-restricted UAV system. In this work, we explore a direction where only inexpensive, static metasurface units are required to dynamically create a PWE. Speciﬁcally, inspired by late trends in UAV-based delivery of goods [8], we consider a set of UAVs, where each one can dynamically position a metasurface, which can only serve a speciﬁc wave manipulation functionality, such as steering an impinging wave to a speciﬁc direction of departure. Therefore, by following an orchestration process, the UAVs can ﬁne-tune these static metasurface units properly to form cascading channels [9] and, thus, improve the quality-of-service (QoS) of the network users in terms of connectivity and security. Hence, compared to synergetic UAV-RIS networks, the proposed approach has the beneﬁt of low-cost and simplicity, as the UAV-orchestrated metasurfaces can transform a wireless propagation environ- ment into a dynamic PWE.\\n\\nSecurity, Energy Efﬁciency.\\n\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe remainder of this paper is as follows. Section II details the proposed scheme. Evaluation follows in Section III and the conclusion in Section IV.\\n\\nRecently, a wireless communication paradigm has emerged, which strives to constitute the wireless propagation phe- nomenon into a software-deﬁned and deterministic process [1]. This direction, denoted as programmable wireless environ- ments (PWEs), is enabled via coating planar objects in a space with metasurfaces, more recently known as reconﬁg- urable intelligent surfaces (RISs). RISs constitute a merge of metasurfaces with well-deﬁned networking and programming interfaces. Employing the Huygens principle, RIS can ma- nipulate impinging waves by altering their power, direction, polarization, and phase [2]. Thus, RIS can be dynamically orchestrated to realize custom end-to-end propagation routes, e.g., to avoid unintended users, increase the quality of the wireless channels, or even realize futuristic applications such as extended reality [1], [3], [4].\\n\\nPWEs are presently combined with ﬂexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which carry RIS units to carefully selected places and conﬁgure their electromagnetic behavior dynam- ically [5], [6], [7]. While promising, this approach burdens with additional cost and power consumption an already high-\\n\\nII. UAV-DEPLOYABLE PWE WITH STATIC METASURFACES\\n\\nFig. 1 represents a schematic of the proposed system archi- tecture. We consider an environment hosting wireless users, with multiple blockages present. In this setting, a UAV swarm is licensed to operate under the command of a UAV ﬂight control system.

Each metasurface can serve only one static wave manipulation functionality, such as steering from and to very speciﬁc wave directions of arrival and departure.\\n\\nis assumed to be delegated a communication assistance task by a third-party communication system, which monitors its users and deduces the connectivity requirements. Subsequently, it invokes the UAV ﬂight control to dynamically deploy a PWE in the premise of the users in need of assistance or communication augmentation.

Following the orchestration planning phase, the UAV control instructs a set of UAVs in the swarm to pick up the selected RIS units and move to positions designated by the orchestration process. Once there, the channel is deployed automatically, without further deliberations.\\n\\nWe proceed to detail the speciﬁcations and workﬂow of each component of the proposed architecture, i.e., the UAV ﬂight control and orchestration system, the static metasurface units, and the dynamic PWE orchestration and conﬁguration process.\\n\\nA. UAV ﬂight control and orchestration system\\n\\nAs a UAV ﬂeet scales horizontally, efﬁcient management methods are required to ensure its safety and high performance in terms of placement and energy requirements [8]. Therefore, controlling a UAV swarm is a complex operation that requires a fully automated and omniscient orchestrator, which is a crucial software component of any UAV network to guarantee its continuous operation.\\n\\nFig. 2. UAV orchestrator components and information ﬂow.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the UAV orchestrator consists of three main\\n\\ncomponents:\\n\\nUAV Trafﬁc Manager (UTM): The UTM is the main brain of the orchestrator. It is responsible for the placement of the UAVs while taking into account various restrictions and feedback from other components, such as the UAV energy requirements, the client QoS requirements, the weather conditions, and the airspace authorization. More-\\n\\nover, it is responsible for grouping the UAV network to allow the division of the network for different use cases. • UAV Energy Manager (UEM): One of the major limita- tions in the UAV operation is their energy needs. The UEM is responsible for preventing power outages of UAVs and handling their recharging through charging stations [10]. The decisions made by the UEM are delivered at the UTM for appropriate mobility actions\\n\\nand resource allocation.\\n\\nNetwork Monitor: The network monitor is aware of the QoS needs of each speciﬁc client, as well as the needs of the different use cases that would enable possible UAV network slicing procedures. Therefore, informs the UTM to take appropriate actions on the UAV placement and grouping, respectively. it\\n\\nIn Fig. 2, we present the information ﬂow among the different UAV orchestrator components.\\n\\nB. Non-programmable Metasurfaces\\n\\nFig. 3. (a) Front and (b) back side of metasurface units; only the effective aperture is shown 1826 cells of 9 mm width, while the insets depict a detail of a 2-by-2 cell cluster. (c) Perspective-view of an anechoic chamber, to acquire a measurement of the board static functionality.\\n\\nMetasurfaces are composite materials exhibiting engineered macroscopic electromagnetic (EM) properties. They comprise speciﬁcally EM-tuned and spatially-arranged unit cells (or meta atoms) that collectively interact with the impinging wave- front to provide a given scattered (e.g., reﬂected) wavefront; embedding reconﬁgurable components (e.g., PIN diodes) in the cells allows active control of the response. Metasurfaces can control most aspects of the scattered wavefront, e.g., its amplitude, direction/phase, polarization, even frequency. The efﬁciency of this control scheme is determined by the unit cell architecture and the performance of the embedded components. Given the complexities of the underlying physical mechanisms, simpliﬁed methods for calculating the meta- surface conﬁguration-response relation have been proposed, such as antenna arrays with phase and amplitude control per element or equivalent circuit models. These serve distinct purposes in deﬁning the accessible metasurface functions [2]. Notably, this description refers to reprogrammable metasur- face units, where the embedded switches are controlled via software. Thus, the same metasurface can be tuned in real- time to serve different types of wave manipulation function- alities. However, one can replace the dynamically switching elements with passive and non-tunable electronic packages, offering ﬁxed impedance to the traversing signals. When properly selected in this manner, one can manufacture non- programmable metasurface units that serve a very speciﬁc functionality, such as full wave absorption from a given angle of incidence, anomalous steering for a given set of speciﬁc angles (arrival and departure), anomalous n-way splitting, etc. Such a metasurface example, manufactured with printed\\n\\ncircuit board technology, is given in Fig. 3 [11]. Moreover, metasurfaces can offer the beneﬁts of requiring no power to operate and no need for networking capabilities. As such, if one possesses a UAV control system and a set of metasurfaces, one can also deploy a PWE dynamically.\\n\\nC. PWE deployment and conﬁguration abstracted\\n\\nDeploying a PWE dynamically requires a macroscopic approach in its modeling and conﬁguration. To this end, we revisit the PWE graph, G (V, E), introduced in [1]. This model considers a graph where each user device and each RIS is a vertex v ∈ V . Moreover, we add one edge e ∈ E between two vertexes that are within LOS. Given this graph, it should be also considered a user u that employs Eu ⊂ E edges to connect to RIS around it. Furthermore, we assume an access point that is connected to Ea ⊂ E of the total RIS units. The PWE conﬁguration is then equivalent to ﬁnding vertex- disjoint paths that connect each e ∈ Eu to any e∗ ∈ Ea. Once such paths are found, e.g., via the algorithms presented in [1], they can be instantiated by deploying the corresponding wave steering commands to each RIS represented by the vertexes upon each path.\\n\\nHowever, in the studied UAV-driven PWE case, metasurface units are not ﬁxed in terms of location. In addition, the con- sidered units can serve only one speciﬁc wave manipulation functionality, such as reﬂecting a given direction of wave arrival to a given direction of wave departure. This approach makes the PWE conﬁguration more dynamic, opening a future research challenge. In the context of this short paper, we outline a greedy solution as follows. We mark a set of possible UAV points in space and add them to the graph. Then, we execute the outlined PWE conﬁguration algorithm. Once the paths are found, we observe how many of the returned vertexed paths can be served by the available set of metasurface units and their static wave steering angles. We mark those units and corresponding vertexes as “busy”, and we remove the non- busy path vertexes from the graph. Subsequently, we attempt to reconnect gaps in the intended air links, but iteratively execute a path-ﬁnding algorithm, e.g., Dijkstra, between the gap end- points, and then repeat the process until the path is formed (or until a given set of retries expires).\\n\\nNotably, the proposed algorithm does not account for limi- tations in the UAV swarm or runtime concerns. Focusing here on a proof of concept, we deﬁne these concerns to be in the scope of extensions of the present study.\\n\\nIII. EVALUATION\\n\\nWe proceed to evaluate the use of a UAV-deployed PWE in a simple setting, using a PWE simulator [1]. The objective is to perform an initial comparison in a ray-tracing setting, and in a simple geometry, using regular propagation (non-PWE) as a baseline.\\n\\nWe consider a transmitter (Tx)-receiver (Rx) pair in the ﬂoorplan and setup shown in Table I, which consists of a Tx and an Rx on the plane, separated by a perfect absorber (red wall) between them.

Moreover, we assume that 15 UAVs are available, as well as a set of static metasurface units, which are enough to serve any possible set of wave propagation angles that can be formed in the setup. Subsequently, we execute the process described in Section II-C.\\n\\nVisualizations of the ray-traced outcome of the UAV-driven PWE are given in Fig. 4. Using all available UAV positions, the dynamically formed PWE steers all major rays propagated by the Tx to the Rx. In this way, the middle obstacle (red wall) is bypassed during the wireless propagation phenomenon.\\n\\nThe received power per scheme is given in Table III. Notably, the employed setup offers no natural connectivity. On the other hand, the UAV-driven PWE approach restores connectivity and yields a received power of −49.87 dBmW .\\n\\nIV. CONCLUSION\\n\\nThis work presented a way of dynamically deploying PWEs with the aid of UAVs but under the condition of employing static metasurfaces which serve a speciﬁc wave manipulation functionality. Each UAV of the swarm selects and mounts an available passive metasurface, and proceeds to position itself within a space to form cascaded wireless channels for user serving. The work concluded by presenting a simulated example of the proposed approach operation, showing that the UAV-driven PWE can effectively restore connectivity.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\n\\nThis work was funded by projects HERMES (EU Hori- zon 2020, GA 891515), WISAR (Foundation for Research\\n\\nFig. 4.

The solder paste with some fluid properties could slump and the unbalance between different sides of solder paste can lead to other forces on the components as well. Though the shifts are usually considered to be negligible and can be made up to some extent by the following self-alignment during the process of soldering reflow, it should be attracted attention as its importance for addressing the quality of the printed circuit board (PCB) in SMT. To minimize or control the component shifts, whose relationship with the characteristics of the solder paste (e.g., offset, volume) should be studied initially. In this paper, we design a comprehensive experiment and collect the data from a state-of-the-art SMT assembly line. Then we use support vector regression (SVR) model to predict the component shifts based on different situations of solder paste and placement settings. Also, two kernel functions, linear (SVR-Linear) and radial basis function (SVR-RBF), are employed. The achieved results indicate that the component shift in P&P process is significant, and the SVR model is highly qualified for the forecast of the component shifts. Particularly, the SVR-RBF model outperforms the SVR-Linear model considering the prediction error.\\n\\nKeywords: Component shifts, SMT, Pick and place, SVR, Machine learning;\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\n1.1. Surface Mount Technology\\n\\nSurface mount technology (SMT) is well-known as an essential method for electronic component assembly. The main operations in a surface mount assembly (SMA) line are stencil printing process (SPP), pick and place (P&P), and solder reflow (for detail, see Fig. 1). A PCB stencil is aligned on the surface of the boards and solder paste is applied using a squeegee blade to ensure the pads are coated with a controlled amount of solder paste. Then, the components are mounted onto the PCB boards in their respective positions by a P&P machine. Finally, the boards are passed through a reflow oven, in which the flux in the solder paste will evaporate, and the solder paste will be melt into liquid and form solder joints.\\n\\nExcept the three main processes mentioned above, the PCB boards in an SMA line need to be tested respectively by a Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) machine, and one or two Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) machines to evaluate the quality of outcome for each process. Mainly, SPI checks the quality of the solder paste after printing; Pre-AOI, which is located before the reflowing oven, takes charge of testing the placed components after P&P process. Post- AOI is more popular than Pre-AOI. It is laid following the reflow oven, exams the assembled components after reflow soldering.\\n\\nShun Cao / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000\\n\\nFig. 1. Main processes of Surface mount technology [1].\\n\\n1.2. Component Shift in P&P Process\\n\\nThe P&P operations are applied on a Surface Mount Device (SMD) and widely used in the electronics industry. When the component is placed on the wet solder paste, which could be considered as a temporary adhesive [2], it is to be held in position by the tackiness of solder paste [3]. However, the position of the placed component might be changed before entering the heating stage as the wet solder paste is a viscous non-Newtonian fluid which slumps more or less during the P&P process [4~6]. Also, if the component is placed poorly on the solder paste or the solder paste is too thin, too thick or too unbalanced etc., other forces will act on the placed component and cause the component shifts on it. Besides, there are many other indirect potential factors that can lead to component shifts, such as machine’s vibration, PCB’s oblique, conveyor’s instability.\\n\\nIn practice, the component shifts in P&P process are often underestimated because its tiny amount of the measured distance and the following reflow soldering is considered as a standard way to make up the shifts and placement error [7]. However, with the desire of decreasing defective rate of assembled products in SMT, and the decreasing size of the electronic components, the component shifts in P&P process are no more ignorable, i.e., the tiny shifts may bring out significant misalignment from the small components. But note that it is difficult to detect the component shifts merely by AOI machine in the SMA line since the difference between designed and tested positions of the component are normlay tangled with the variation from the P&P process, inaccuracy from the inspection equipment, and other hidden environmental situations (e.g., temperature, humidity). In this paper, a comprehensive experiment, which considers a variety of possible situations, even some of them rarely happens in practice, is designed for this study.\\n\\n1.3. Support Vector Regression\\n\\nSupport vector regression (SVR) have attracted significant attention as its importance becomes genuinely recognized for regression purposes [8]. It is extended from support vector machine (SVM) by the introduction of an alternative loss function.\\n\\n2\\n\\nShun Cao / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000\\n\\nFig. 2. The soft margin loss setting for linear SVR [8].\\n\\nThe basic idea of SVR prediction model is shown in Fig. 2. Given the training dataset as data {(𝑥!, 𝑦!), … , (𝑥\", 𝑦\") ∈ 𝑋 × ℝ, where 𝑋 denotes the space of input patterns. SVR’s ultimate goal is to find a function 𝑓(𝑥) that has at most ε deviation from the actually obtained targets 𝑦# for all the training dataset, and at the same time is as flat as possible [8]. The function of SVR can be written as follows:\\n\\n𝑚𝑖𝑛\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ! $ 𝑠. 𝑡.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t𝑦# − 〈𝜔, 𝑥#〉 − 𝑏 ≤ 𝜀 − 𝜉# ∗ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t〈𝜔, 𝑥#〉 + 𝑏 − 𝑦# \\t ≤ 𝜀 − 𝜉# \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t𝜉#, 𝜉#\\n\\n\" ∗ ‖𝜔‖$ + 𝐶 ∑ (𝜉# + 𝜉# #&!\\n\\n) (1)\\n\\n∗ \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ≥ 0\\n\\n∗ are to cope with other infeasible constraints of the convex optimization problem for each 𝑖-th sample. The constant 𝐶 > 0 determines the trade-off between the flatness of 𝑓(𝑥) and the amount up to which deviations larger than ε. The flexibility of SVR is in regard to its various kernel functions. Besides, we use two most popular kernel functions as well, one of which is linear kernel function. It is computationally fast and less prone to overfitting. The other one is the radial basis function (RBF), it not only is computational efficient, but also is more suitable to solve the nonlinear problems.\\n\\nWhere 〈∙,∙〉 denotes the dot product, ‖𝜔‖$ denotes the 𝐿$ norm of ω. The slack variables 𝜉#, 𝜉#\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: the design of experiments, different experimental settings and the detail of acquired datasets are introduced in Sec. 2; the behavior of the component shifts in P&P process is briefly studied in Sec. 3; mathematical process and the prediction results are discussed in Secs. 4; and finally, conclusions are summarized in Sec. 5.\\n\\n2. Experimental Setup and Data Description\\n\\n2.1. Experimental Setup\\n\\nThe experiment was carried out in the field laboratory, which contains a complete state-of-the-art SMT assembly line. The schematic diagram of the SMA line is shown in Fig. 3. One specifically designed PCB board is used in this experiment, on which the pads are coupled with each other corresponding to one electronic component. As represented in Table 1, nine parameters: solder paste offsets\\t𝑋, 𝑌, angle, solder paste average volume, the difference of solder paste volume, place pressure, and designed offsets\\t𝑋, 𝑌, angle are controlled and adjusted to form 33 different experimental settings according to the theory of design of experiments (DOE). Except that, 6 types of components (shown in Table 2) and 20 replications for each setting are implemented in this experiment as well.\\n\\n3\\n\\nShun Cao / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000\\n\\nFig. 3. Surface mount assembly line in the field laboratory.\\n\\nThe experimental flowchart is shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, a specialist of SMT designed the experiment (the solder paste offsets, solder paste volume and placement offsets) based on the D-Optimal designs in DOE. After customizing this piece of PCB board, the solder paste is printed on it according to various solder paste offsets and volumes. SPI machine detects the actual values of solder paste offsets and volumes. Then the PCB board is passed in P&P process, in which the components are placed on the corresponding pair of pads on PCB, based on the settings of part designed offset\\t𝑋, part designed offset 𝑌, part designed angle and place pressure. Finally, the AOI machine tests the actual component’s offsets.\\n\\nTable 1.

Data Description\\n\\nThe amount of the components used in the experiment is 3960 (660×6). The datasets acquired from the SMA line are SPI dataset (size: 7920=3960×2, one component corresponds to two solder paste data) and AOI dataset (size: 3960). All the factors used in this paper are shown in Table 3, in which the offsets are defined as the distances based on the centers: pad center (a pair of pads), solder paste center (a pair of solder paste) and the component center. We illustrate the way of measuring offsets in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b). Besides, the offsets and volume are designed proportionally based on the size of the component (except angle), therefore, the offsets and volume are transformed to ratios in the prediction model.\\n\\nTable 3.

The Behavior of Component Shifts in P&P Process\\n\\nIt is challenging to investigate the behavior of component shifts in P&P process barely based on the rough data acquired from the SMA line. In this paper, we assume the component shifts are the difference between the designed and tested component positions (for detail, see table 3), though the placement and testing errors are entangled in it. Fig. 6 shows the behavior of the component shifts in P&P process as a case example. In which the black rectangle\\n\\n5\\n\\nShun Cao / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000\\n\\ndenotes the designed position of capacitor chip 0402 in setting 1, and the light blue rectangles signify the tested positions of the 20 repeated placements with the same setting. Note that the dimension and position of the rectangles in the figure are depicted according to the actual values in the dataset. The replicated components’ positions do not distribute randomly around the designed poison, but tend to distribute in a certain direction. Fig. 7 and Table 4 can show more information of the component shifts in three directions respectively. Apparently, the component shifts in P&P process are significant. A few of shift Ys are even greater than 10% of the component width (500\\tµm). Moreover, the component shift angles are distributed far from the designed position as well, larger than the designed value 0°.\\n\\nFig. 6.

Results\\n\\nIn this section, we estimate component shifts in P&P process based on the 33 settings of DOE using one of the most classical machine learning model: support vector regression (SVR). The selection of kernel function is crucial to SVR’s prediction accuracy [9]. In this paper, two most popular kernel functions are utilized with SVR model: linear\\n\\nMax.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n…\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n6\\n\\nShun Cao / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000\\n\\nfunction (SVR-Linear) and radial basis function (SVR-RBF). In order to evaluate the performance of SVR-Linear and SVR-RBF to recognize whether they are qualified to predict the component shifts, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the prediction error.\\n\\nFurthermore, since the absence of a huge size of the dataset that can be used to train the prediction model, we apply 𝑘-fold Cross-Validation (𝑘-fold CV) to improve the performance of the prediction model with the limited data. In term of the implementation of 𝑘-fold CV, the 𝑘’s value could notably affect the results of the estimation. Therefore, we use model of SVR-RBF and the metric of RMSE to select the proper value of 𝑘. The results are shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious to see the turning stage of shift 𝑋 and shift 𝑌. However, it hard to discern any turning point in shift angle. Normally, it is recommended that 𝑘 = 5 or 𝑘 = 10 [10]. In this paper, we choose 𝑘 = 10 for the relative lower prediction error, though a little computational efficiency is sacrificed.\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nc\\n\\nFig. 8. (a) RMSE across 𝑘-fold in 𝑥 direction; (b) RMSE across 𝑘-fold in 𝑦 direction; (c) RMSE across 𝑘-fold in angular direction\\n\\nExcept for the selection of kernel function, SVR’s prediction accuracy of is also depended on the tuning of the multiple hyper parameters. The related hyper parameters: 𝐶 and 𝜀 in SVR-Linear (shown in function 1) and\\t𝐶, 𝜀, 𝛾 SVR-RBF model respectively. 𝛾 is an important free parameter to decide the variance in SVR-RBF. Notice that, it is time-consuming to select the optimal combination of the three parameters by hand. Fortunately, Grid Search model could help to address this issue, which is simply an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of the hyper parameter space of a learning algorithm [11]. In this paper, the selected values of the hyper parameters are 𝐶 = 1.0, 𝜀 = 0.031 and 𝐶 = 0.13, 𝛾 = 1.0, 𝜀 = 0.00097 for SVR-Linear and SVR-RBF respectively.\\n\\nTable 5 summarizes the prediction errors (MAE and RMSE) of the component shifts in P&P process using SVR- Linear and SVR-RBF models. The prediction errors are quite small for shift 𝑋 and shift 𝑌, which showed that SVR model is capable of estimating the component shift 𝑋 and shift 𝑌 with high precision levels. It also means that the component shift 𝑋 and shift 𝑌 are explained well by the 9-controlled solder paste and placement parameters in SVR model. Given the condition of solder paste after printing (or the test results of SPI) and certain placement strategy, the actual position of the placed components can be accurately predicted. Also, it is easy to notice that the prediction error of shift 𝑋 is lower than shift 𝑌. This could be explained by the larger designed variance in 𝑋 direction (see Table 1) which can provide more information to train the prediction model. However, neither SVR-Linear or SVR-RBF model can estimate the shift angle well. It probably because some other key factors outside the 9 parameters are missed in our model. In terms of the two models, the SVR-RBF outperforms SVR-Linear considering the prediction errors: MAE and RMSE respectively. This indicates that the relationship between the 9 parameters and the component shifts in P&P process is not linear but non-linear. And the Gaussian-based SVR-RBF model is more suitable for the non- linear problems than SVR-Linear model.\\n\\nTable 5.

Conclusions\\n\\nIn this research work, we have studied the component shifts in P&P process. A comprehensive experiment is designed and carried on a complete state-of-the-art SMT assembly line. 9 parameters of solder paste and placement are controlled or adjusted according to the theory of DOE. The SVR model is applied to predict the component shifts based on the two datasets: solder paste data (SPI) and component data (AOI). The feasibility of applying SVR methodology to predict the component shifts is evaluated. And the implementation of two kernel functions: SVR- Linear and SVR-RBF were used in the prediction model as well. Besides, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are utilized to show the prediction accuracy and to test the performance of SVR-Linear model and SVR-RBF model. The results indicate that the component shifts in P&P process should not be ignored. And the SVR model is effective and attractive to estimate component shift X and shift Y with the high level of accuracy. Moreover, the SVR-RBF is superior to SVR-Linear in our case. However, the component shift angle is not addressed well in our case. To create a clearer and more effective prediction model of component shifts, especially for shift angle, we will still need to extend the scope of the involved factors to machinery, inspectional accuracy, environmental factors, etc. Thus, it will encompass more related factors to better estimate the component shifts in P&P process.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for your comments on this paper.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Tsai, Tsung-Nan. \"Modeling and optimization of stencil printing operations: A comparison study.\" Computers & Industrial Engineering 54.3\\n\\n(2008): 374-389.\\n\\n[2] Hwang, Jennie S.

       " Document(page_content='3D pavement surface reconstruction using an RGB-D sensor\\n\\nA core procedure of pavement management systems is data collection. The modern technologies which are used for this purpose, such as point-based lasers and laser scanners, are too expensive to purchase, operate, and maintain. Thus, it is rarely feasible for city officials in developing countries to conduct data collection using these devices. This paper aims to introduce a cost-effective technology which can be used for pavement distress data collection and 3D pavement surface reconstruction. The applied technology in this research is the Kinect sensor which is not only cost-effective but also sufficiently precise. The Kinect sensor can register both depth and color images simultaneously. A cart is designed to mount an array of Kinect sensors. The cameras are calibrated and the slopes of collected surfaces are corrected via the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Then, a procedure is proposed for stitching the RGB_D (Red Green Blue–Depth) images using SURF (Speeded-up Robust Features) and MSAC (M-estimator SAmple Consensus) algorithms in order to create a 3D-structure of the pavement surface.

Agolroo@aut.ac.ir\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nData collection is an important part of pavement management systems. It is mainly conducted through two methods: manual and semi-automated (or automated). The first method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and imprecise. The second one is carried out using automated data collection vehicles which are too expensive to implement.\\n\\nThe trade-off between collecting high-quality data and costs of data collection should be considered. There are only a few studies available that used a set of inexpensive and accurate sensors for pavement data collection [1]–[7]. Microsoft Kinect sensors are novel and inexpensive technologies, which can be used for collecting pavement surface distresses data, such as potholes and rutting. Microsoft Kinect V2 is an integrated device containing the RGB and Infrared cameras [8]. This sensor is widely used in different fields of engineering, such as robotic and biomedical engineering, but it is still new in transportation engineering. By considering the capability of this sensor in capturing RGB and depth images simultaneously, it can be used in the field of pavement engineering to generate 3D reconstruction of pavement surfaces in order to collect pavement distress data.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nFirst, a cart was designed and built. The designed cart has the ability to perform data collection in both static and dynamic modes and covers the entire width of a lane (i.e., 3.65 m). By conducting some sample data collection, the collected RGB and depth data were registered. Figure 1 shows a sample of depth data from a rutted pavement surface.\\n\\nFigure 1. A sample of depth data from a pavement surface\\n\\nThe post-processing step contains four major steps; selecting the ROI (region of interest), applying filters for enhancing image quality, correcting the slope, and stitching the depth and RGB images. Firstly, the central part of a depth frame was considered for image processing procedures. After that, a Gaussian filter was applied to the data for reducing the noise effects. Figure 1 shows that the depth image plane is not parallel to a zero-slope pavement surface. So, there is a need to correct the slope. Afterwards, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm was used [9] to correct the slope of collected depth surfaces, as Figure 1 shows that the depth image plane is not parallel to a zero-slope pavement surface.\\n\\nBy calibrating the images and calculating the transformation matrix between the RGB and depth images, the RGB images were stitched. In order to do that, different algorithms such as Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF) [10] and Robust M-estimator SAmple Consensus (MSAC) were used. [11]–[13] Figure 2 to Figure 4 shows how these techniques are working.\\n\\nFigure 2. Finding corresponding features using SURF algorithm\\n\\nFigure 3. Remove outliers using MSAC algorithm\\n\\nFigure 4. Stitched RGB images\\n\\nResults and Discussion\\n\\nBy having the stitched RGB images and using the transformation matrix between IR and RGB images, the depth images were stitched. Figure 3 shows the matched (stitched) depth data from a cross section of pavement.\\n\\nFigure 5. Stitched depth data\\n\\nFinally, the 3D structure of the pavement was constructed. In order to investigate the reliability of the proposed approach, some field experiments were conducted. Figure 6 shows a sample of transverse profiles (extracted from matched depth data) of pavement surface which has rutting distress with different severity levels.\\n\\nFigure 6. Transverse profiles of pavement surfaces\\n\\nTo investigate the accuracy and precision of Kinect sensor, a data collection was performed from asphalt pavement. The distance between the sensor and pavement was measured using an accurate laser distance meter. Figure 7 shows the result of measurement through a Kinect sensor in comparison to the ground truth (laser distance meter measurement). The coefficient of determination shows that the proposed system is accurate enough.\\n\\nFigure 7. Estimated distance values versus the ground truth\\n\\nFurthermore, to investigate the reliability of the proposed system in collecting the pavement surface defects such as potholes, the dimensions of some artificial defects were measured and compared to the real dimensions. The results show that the mean relative error values are 3.93%, 2.3% and 7.22% for depth, width and length of artificial defects, respectively.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThis paper proposed a cost-effective system which is accurate and precise for collecting pavement distress data and creating a 3D reconstruction of pavement surfaces. The result of this study can be summarized as follows:\\n\\nDesigning and building an appropriate device on which an array of Kinect sensors can be mounted. • Stitching the RGB and depth images which were captured from pavement surfaces and generating a 3D structure of pavement.\\n\\nEvaluating the reliability of the proposed system.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] A.

A stencil is a thin sheet of material (typically stainless steel) with a series of apertures (holes) cut into it which suit the PCB to be printed. The function of the solder paste stencil is to accurately deposit the correct amount of solder paste onto the surface mount pads so that the solder joint between PCB pad and component terminal are acceptable with regard to the electrical connection and mechanical strength.

Typically the stencil thickness would be between 4 thou and 8 thou thick. If the stencil is too thick for the size of apertures then it can lead to the paste being held by surface tension to the inner walls of the aperture. The following is a formula that shows the difference between aspect ratio and area ratio of stencil apertures:- The release of solder paste from the apertures of the stencil is also affected by the particle size of the selected solder paste.

Aperture Design This is important to stop solder defects from forming such as bridging and solder beads. Most apertures are designed to be slightly smaller than the pads (typically 2 thou reduction all round) to provide a good gasket seal between stencil and PCB but some apertures need a special design to deposit less paste on the inner edge of the part to reduce the possibility of ‘mid-chip’ solder balls forming. Below is an example of a possible solution known as ‘home-plate’ apertures and a photo of ‘mid-chip’ solder balls.

There are different aperture shapes within a typical stencil design such as squares, rectangles and circles - all of which have different effects on the transfer of solder paste to the PCB. It may be a surprise to learn but the best aperture shape to achieve the greatest solder paste transfer efficiency is the ' squircle'.

Stencil Material and Mounting The material type of the stencil will have an impact on its ability to release the solder paste from the apertures. Stainless steel is typically used but for PCB designs that have fine pitch devices a more expensive alternative (Nickel – approx. 50% more expensive than stainless steel) can be used. Other possibilities are to apply a coating to either material to further improve the release of paste from the apertures – An example of this is NanoProTek coating which is an additional fixed cost but does need to be re-applied periodically. There are occasions where PCB designs contain a large variety of parts including fine pitch devices that require a thin stencil and larger parts that require a thicker stencil.

Step-up areas are created by adding material to the stencil and are used to increase the volume and height of the solder paste in selected areas - Useful for ‘pin in paste’ and large format devices. Step-down areas are created by removing material from the stencil and are used to reduce the volume and height of the solder paste deposit in selected areas. In order to print successfully, apertures must be designed to be a minimum distance from the step edge. The distance is dependent on the step dimensions and is known as the ‘keep out area’.

       " Document(page_content='of fiducial marks to the stencil will ensure good alignment is achieved as shown below. Perfectly aligned solder paste on pads PCB Design Specific There can be occasions where components within the PCB design have large copper pads underneath the device, which as well as providing a secure electrical connection, are also used to dissipate heat from the device. If the area of the whole pad has solder paste applied it can result in the device lifting and the outer leads not soldering. This can be overcome by creating a ‘window effect’ in the stencil aperture design to reduce the solder volume as can be seen below. Another PCB design feature on the same type of device that can cause undesirable results is when vias are included within the large copper pad to again dissipate heat from the device. In this case the stencil apertures can be specially designed to avoid the solder paste from being deposited onto the vias as can be seen below.

Conclusion The printing stage of the assembly process is vitally important. If there are errors introduced at this stage there will be “knock on” effects throughout the process ultimately resulting in process failures. To achieve good repeatable printing results, it is important to use a stencil that is designed with all the appropriate points considered. Most PCB’s can be printed without needing to use a complex stencil design but there can be occasions where it is necessary to use many of the considerations discussed.

       " Document(page_content='surface mount operations, particularly within the sub-contract manufacturing sector, run as low as 20% efficient. There are many reasons that contribute to this figure but it fundamentally means that only 20% of the capital investment is being utilized. Financially speaking, this will lead to a higher cost of ownership and a slower return on investment. For the customer, it can cause longer lead times for their product and therefore the business will not be as competitive in the market place. With production efficiencies at this level there will be many knock-on effects that will have an impact on the business such as larger batch sizes, more parts in stock, more assemblies in WIP (work in progress) and slower reaction times to customer change requirements. With all this in mind there is a strong incentive to improve efficiency while maintaining quality.

It plays a vital role in providing solutions in manufacturing industries. After the proper alignment of the board on the PCB stencil, you can pull solder paste through the Stencil to fill in the Stencil's holes. The PCB stencil's sole purpose is to transfer wet lead to the bare board. The amount of damp information entering the board determines by the thickness of the stainless steel foil and the opening size.

       " Document(page_content=\"This SMT stencil technology has high scope due to its speed, reliability, and low cost compared to other primitive methods. What is SMT Stencil? Surface Mount Technology, also known as SMT, produces electrical components that involve mounting the components directly on the surface of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). SMT's relevance has gone a long way toward replacing the previous electronic component production format, Through-Hole Technology. With an SMT or PCB stencil, you can evenly spread solder paste on a circuit board before selling the PCB components. Previously, the board's stainless steel foil created an opening for each part attached to it. When you remove the stainless-steel foil from the board, the solder paste remains, and you can adhere it to the circuit board using the SMT stencil.

Laser Cutting It is a thermal process that melts material in a specific area using a focused laser beam. You can create an aperture by focusing the laser machine on a stencil foil. It is, without a doubt, a subtractive procedure, but the result is always precise and produces a high-quality cut. That is why it is one of the most commonly used procedures. Electroforming It entails creating stencil parts by depositing material in bits. As a result, you will have a replica. Nonetheless, this process is notable for its complexity and high repeatability. As a result, electroformed stencils produce thicknesses ranging from 2 to 7 mils and increments of 0.01 mil. Because there is no burr, there is no need for polishing or buffing with this method.

Therefore Chemically Etched stencils were provided for better open areas and worked well for SMT devices with lead pitches down to 0.8 mm. The Chemically Etched trapezoidal aperture, along with enabling post processes of electropolish and nickel plating, helped smooth aperture sidewalls, improving paste transfer.

Early laser-cut speeds were slow, so hybrid stencils were popular where large apertures were Chemically Etched and small apertures were laser-cut. Rubber squeegee blades worked well with screens, but scooped paste from larger apertures, reducing paste volume transferred.

With the help of this ratio good paste transfer is performed. Aspect ratio is a good guide if the length of the aperture is greater (at least 5×) than the width. But again with the introduction of BGA’s and QFN’s aspect ratio has certain limitations.

Hybrid is a combination of chemically etched and laser-cut. Chemically Etched is very useful for step stencils and hybrid stencils. Chemical Etching Process Metal mask and flexible metal mask stencils are etched by chemical milling from both sides using two positive img. During this process, etching proceeds not only in the desired vertical direction but also laterally. This is called undercutting, the openings are larger than desired, causing extra solder deposit.

Because electroetched stencil walls may not be smooth, electropolishing, a microetching process, is one method for achieving a smooth wall. Another way to achieve smoother side walls in the aperture is nickel plating. A polished or smooth surface is good for paste release but may cause the paste to skip across the stencil surface rather than roll in front of the squeegee. This problem can be avoided by selectively polishing the aperture walls without polishing the stencil surface. Nickel plating further improves smoothness and printing performance. However, it does reduce aperture opening and requires artwork adjustment. Laser Cut Process Laser-cut is a subtractive process.

The smoothness of cut depends on many parameters, including cut speed, beam spot size, laser power and beam focus. The typical beam spot size is about 1.25 mils. The laser can cut very accurate aperture sizes over a wide range of size and shape requirements. As with Chemically Etched, the laser-cut aperture size must be adjusted to the post-processing treatment employed because aperture size change will occur during this process.

Stencil printing process can be divided into three categories: the aperture-fill process, the paste-transfer process, and the positional location of the deposited paste. All three processes play a vital role in achieving the desired result - a precise volume of paste (a brick) deposited to the correct location on the substrate.

Paste left on the squeegee side over large apertures will be pulled down through the aperture, resulting in excess solder. Proper squeegee pressure is the minimum pressure that achieves a clean wipe of the paste. Minimum pressure is a function of blade type.

For example, a 20-mil pitch quad flat pack (QFP) with an aperture design of 10 mil X 60 mil in a 5-mil stencil has an aspect ratio of 2.0 and an area ratio of 0.86.

SMT Stencil is a thin metal sheet used in the soldering process for SMT (Surface Mount Technology) and it plays an essential role in the SMT soldering process. Smt Stencil allows the direct placement of solder paste onto the SMD pads of PCB, which can help prevent errors and defects during the reflow soldering process. This results in a precise amount of tin coverage once the work is completed. Types of SMT Stencils Depending on the application of solder paste, there are three different types of stencils that are generally used.

Framed stencil consists of a normal laser cut stencil sheet stained to the metal frame. This type of stencil is most suitable for high-volume SMT assembly due to the frame's ability to provide better stability and reusability of the stencil itself. Frame of the stencil also allows a better and faster process of alignment between the PCB and stencil.Cost of the frame stencil is relatively higher due to the need for additional frame support . Moreover, frameworks require additional storage space and can be more complex to manage. It also makes stencil heavier, increasing shipping costs. Frameless Stencil Unlike framed stencils, frameless stencils do not have a surrounding frame, making them more economical than framed stencils.

Step Stencil: There are various components on the PCB, and each component has different solder paste requirements during the soldering process. Regular laser stencils can only regulate the amount of solder paste by adjusting the size of the openings while overall thickness of the stencil is the same everywhere.

This requirement leads to the use of a step stencil. It allows for printing varying solder paste thicknesses on the same stencil, enabling precise control of the solder volume. How to Choose Your Own SMT Stencil ? The thickness of SMT Stencil The thickness of stencil is a crucial factor in determining the quantity of solder paste which is being placed onto the PCB pad. During the printing process of the stencil, the bottom of the stencil sheet comes into contact with the top surface of the PCB board. Therefore, the thickness of the stencil determines the thickness of the solder paste that is printed onto the surface of the PCB pad. The thickness of SMT stencil should be determined based on the density of PCB components, packaging form and size, and the spacing between pins (or', metadata={'source': 'https://jlcpcb.com/blog/413-how-to-choose-a-smt-stencil'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='that is printed onto the surface of the PCB pad. The thickness of SMT stencil should be determined based on the density of PCB components, packaging form and size, and the spacing between pins (or BGA solder balls). If the spacing between components is small, use thinner ones. If the components on the entire PCB are relatively large, a thicker stencil can be used. On the same PCB, there are both general spacing components above 1.0mm and narrow spacing components. The thickness of the stencil should be selected based on the condition of the majority of components on the PCB board. Popular way to reduce or enlarge the amount of the solder paste applied on the solder pad is by adjusting the pad opening on the stencil. In the PCB design software, this is being done in the “Solder Paste” layer. When components require significantly different amounts of solder paste, localized thinning of the stencil for components with narrow spacing can be employed.

       " Document(page_content='When components require significantly different amounts of solder paste, localized thinning of the stencil for components with narrow spacing can be employed. However, the thinning process incurs higher manufacturing costs. Therefore, a compromise can be made by choosing an intermediate thickness for the stencil to determine the solder paste requirements. For general pitch components, the opening can be 1:1. However, for larger components that require a significant amount of solder paste, the opening area should be increased by 10%-20%. For OFP and other components with pin pitches of 0.65mm and 0.5mm, the opening area should be reduced by 10%.

The stencil material significantly affects its ability to apply solder paste via the holes. Nevertheless, you can increase your stencil’s paste discharge capability by coating it. PCB Stencil Design Circuit boards with copper pads that boost transmission and heat dissipation require stencils with custom designs. Designs lacking pads experience copper lifting and low soldering of external leads. To prevent such issues, you should introduce a ‘window effect’ to your hole design. This prevents the problems by controlling the solder amount.

The good thing is that you can achieve the above requirements by applying multilevel stencils with step-up and step-down parts. Step-up parts are formed by putting more material to specific stencil points. Below are other aspects of PCB stencil design. Aperture Design The design of the holes affects the joints in several ways. First, it influences the chances of faults occurring, like bridging and solder beads. It also acts as a lining cover between the stencil and the board. Alignment This is the final determinant of the accuracy of printing joints on the board.

The thickness must fit into the size of the holes to attain the desired solder joints. An incorrect PCB thickness can make the paste stick to the internal aperture walls because of surface tension. Factors to Consider When Choosing Stencil Thickness Aspect Ratio As mentioned earlier, the stencil thickness determines the amount and height of the paste for forming solder joints. The less the amount, the greater the disconnection chances and the minimal the chances of jumpers. This correlation is known as ‘aspect.’ It is caused by the variances in forces interacting with the paste as it moves down the holes. For instance, a force thrusts the paste past the aperture and another one that grasps the paste inside the holes. The difference between these two forces is described by the aspect ratio (AR).

To attain the highest solder paste deposition, the AR should be higher than one. Basically, the surface tension acting on the paste and the board must be more than the one acting between the paste and the walls of the openings. You can establish the AR value by dividing the aperture ratio with the stencil thickness (W/T) in DIY projects. However, there are industry standards describing the process of finding the stencil thickness appropriate to an opening size. Area Ratio The area ratio is another stencil thickness factor that affects the paste discharge capacity of a stencil. Generally, this is the ratio of the hole surface area to the hole wall surface area. The least acceptable area ratio is 0.66.

QFP and BGA Pitch When establishing the correct stencil thickness, you should also consider the fine-pitch Quad Flat Surface (QFP), Ball Grid Array (BGA), and the least chip size. A QFP with a ≤ 0.5mm pitch, your stencil thickness should range between 0.12mm-0.13mm. A QFP with a more than 0.5mm pitch should have a stencil thickness ranging from 0.15mm-0.20mm. A BGA with a pitch of more than 1.0mm should have a stencil thickness of 0.15mm, while one with a pitch ranging from 0.5mm-1.0mm should have a thickness of 0.13mm. Remember, it is important to factor in the BGA or the minor parts when using multiple integrated circuits simultaneously.

PCB Stencil Maker After acquiring a PCB stencil with the right thickness, you are again challenged with creating apertures of suitable sizes in them. Considering that a stencil contains multiple holes aligned with high accuracy, it is not ideal for creating apertures manually. The common methods of creating stencils with perfect holes are chemical etching, laser cutting, and electroforming. All these methods lead the surfaces of the pore wall to various finishes.

These ﬂuctuations arise from non-uniform ﬂux penetration due to imperfections on the edges. The main observed feature is that both experiment and simulation show an enhancement of the current density at same H during the decrease of the applied ﬁeld. It is important to note that the exper- imental J proﬁles are obtained directly from the MO images, being not related to the critical state models. This explains the discrepancy between experimental and simulation data for decreasing H.

       " Document(page_content='J proﬁles, avalanches are triggered in thicker regions for decreasing ﬁelds in part as a conse- quence of a higher local J. An important ingredient in this case, is the positive feedback due to Joule heating, which depends strongly on the critical current density87. This hysteresis in the threshold ﬁelds for the occurrence of ﬂux avalanches was ﬁrstly described by Qviller et al.91. The main idea is related to the diﬀerence between the applied ﬁeld H and the local ﬁeld Bz close to the edges where avalanches are usually nucleated. Once the ﬁeld is reduced after a maximum value, the currents close to the edges reverse and Bz reaches a minimum value for a higher value of H in this branch when compared to increasing ﬁelds, resulting in higher Jc(Bz) curves for decreasing applied ﬁelds. Therefore, the hysteresis be- tween the increasing and decreasing ﬁelds for triggering ﬂux avalanches can be completely understood based on the TM model, as well as the regions where avalanches are triggered', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09999v1'}),\n",

CONCLUSIONS In summary, we successfully prepared a rectangular wedge-shaped ﬁlm of Pb employing shadow-mask evap- oration. We observed a strong Jc(d) dependency, as the critical current increased by over a factor of four when going from the thicker (154 nm) to the thinner (90 nm) edge. When the upper critical ﬁeld is reached for a cer- tain thickness, the superconducting region undergoes a transition to the normal state revealed by a constant value of Bz along the width of the ﬁlm. Moreover, the variation of Jc with thickness promotes a great diversity of ﬂux avalanche patterns at a ﬁxed temperature. Based on quantitative MOI, the hysteresis of J proﬁles for in- creasing and decreasing applied ﬁelds explains the occur- rence of antiavalanches in', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09999v1'}),\n",

Based on quantitative MOI, the hysteresis of J proﬁles for in- creasing and decreasing applied ﬁelds explains the occur- rence of antiavalanches in the upper half of the specimen. Taking into account the experimental curve Jc(d), the nu- merical simulations based on the TM model presented a consistent correspondence with the experimental results. These ﬁndings show that fabricating wedge-shaped specimens, i.e., exhibiting a thickness gradient, is an in- teresting strategy to investigate in one and the same sam- ple the material properties dependent on thickness. For superconductors, Tc as well as pinning properties can be modulated with suitable thickness.

Pb ﬁlms were fabricated by evaporating 99.999% pure lead placed in a tungsten boat onto a Si (100) substrate. A base pressure of 8 x 10−7 torr is achieced using a liquid-nitrogen cold trap far from the steady substrate holder, which was kept at room temperature. Due to the quick degradation and short lifetime of Pb when exposed to air, a cap layer of Ge was deposited to protect it against oxidation. Through- out the deposition, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based on the OpenQCM project93 was used to monitor the ﬁlm thickness during deposition. To avoid contamination during the ﬁlm deposition, tar- get metals and substrates were cleaned by chemical wet etching. We prepared the following solutions: HF:HNO3 with volume ratio of 1:1 for Ge; CH3COOH:H2O2 with ratio 1:1 for Pb; and Piranha etch for the Si wafers94.

Then a calibrated curve can be generated from known thicknesses to calcu- late the thickness of unknown samples. In our case, we kept the acceleration voltage constant at 5 kV, which is large enough to interact with all diﬀerent layers, includ- ing the substrate, and use the Pb/Ge intensity ratio to map the relative proﬁle of the Pb layer along the gradient thickness of the ﬁlm. Thus, we chose the same positions where the AFM imaging was performed and monitored the relative heights of the X-ray peaks of the three main elements, assuming that the initial energy of the electron beam penetrates deeply enough to interact with all layers con- comitantly.

       " Document(page_content='Partial differential equations (PDEs) have a wide variety of applica- tions, ranging from engineering [1] to biology [2], as well as in machine learning applications such as image processing [3]. The first step in numerically solving any such PDE requires a discretization technique which replaces the continuous equation by a discrete algebraic equa- tion [4]. The discretization technique involves approximating the derivative terms in the PDE by a numerical method such as the finite difference [5–7], finite element [8–10], or finite volume method [11–13], calculated at discrete points, or in other words, the grid points. In this work we focus on the finite difference method, where a linear PDE is discretized at a central point via a linear combination of neighboring points.

For PDEs, stencils at points are coupled to the stencils at neighboring points, which leads to a coupled set of linear equations if the function is unknown. In particular, we are interested in situations where the PDE itself is written as a repeated series of derivatives, such as the biharmonic equation which can be stated as two applications of the Laplace operator, ∆∆u, or where the method chosen to solve a PDE results from the multiple applications of operators. An example of the latter is the Closest Point Method (CPM), which is a technique to solve surface differential equations on embedded surfaces whereby interpolation and derivative stencils are combined [14, 15]. The CPM uses the fact that if the solution on an embedded surface, such as those described by the level-set method [16, 17], is extended into the embedding space such that it is constant in the direction normal to the surface, then standard', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03354v2'}),\n",

This allows for linear sys- tems to be created that allows for the solution of differential equations on arbitrary surfaces in a systematic manner. In both cases (biharmonic or CPM) the end result can be written as a series of (typi- cally) sparse matrix-matrix products. For many reasons (numerical stability, linear system solver speed, memory pre-allocation, etc) it is often advantageous to obtain a single matrix representing these types of systems.

For β > 0 this results in a Taylor series of the β th-derivative of f (xi). We can now compactly write this infinite series using the following notation, (2.5) f (β )(xi) −→ (Si, β ) , where (Si, β ) denotes the Taylor Series expansion of a single source point centered at the target point, and the infinite vector Si contains coefficients associated with each hα si,α f (α+β ): (2.6) ({1, 1, 1 2! , 1 3! , . . .}, β = 0) = f (x0) + h f ′(x0) + 1 2! h2 f ′′(x0) + 1 3! h3 f (3)(x0) + · · · while ({0, 1, 1, 1 2! , 1 3! , . . .}, β = 0) =h f ′(x0) + h2 f ′′(x0) + 1 2! h3 f (3)(x0) (2.7) + 1 3! h4 f (4)(x0) + · · · for a one-dimensional system', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03354v2'}),\n",

In order to show the order of accuracy of the composed stencil, we need to introduce the concept of re-targeting. This involves moving a stencil from a target point y0 ̸= x0 to the original target point x0.

Unlike for accuracy, it is not possible to construct a generalized theorem for the stability of stencil composition from the stability of the inner stencils. Instead, sample cases will be considered and the general stability of stencil compo- sition will be compared to the compact case. Consider the stability of the heat equation for f (x,t), ∂t f = ∂xx f . This can be discretized via Eq. (2.23) and a first-order discretization in time about the point x0: f n −2 − 2 f n 4h2 where n refers to time tn and n + 1 to time tn + ∆t, f n Assume that the solution for the nth time step is f n ξk is the growth factor.

This compares to a requirement of ∆t ≤ h2/2 for the compact version using locations x−1, x0, and x+1. This should be expected as the distance between points in the stencil is twice that for the compact stencil. Common compositions of higher-order derivatives, such as approximating fxxxx using ∂xx (∂xx f ) and center-finite differences, results in the same stencils as compact schemes.

This equation a simplified version of the Cahn-Hilliard equation explored in Sec. 4, neglecting the chemical free energy.

While this is straight-forward to accomplish, it requires that the spatial dimension of the underlying grid be taken into account as there will be additional terms in the z-direction if this is a three-dimensional problem instead of a two-dimensional one. An alternative is to create a single Laplacian stencil and compose this stencil with itself, i.e. using stencil com- position to compute the left-hand side equation of (3.8) directly. From an implementation point-of-view this second approach is much more attractive as any dimension-dependence will already be taken into account when forming the Laplacian stencil.

The error results in the l∞-norm for the given problem are shown in Fig. 3 where the discretization of the Laplacian was achieved using second-order accurate stencils. Based on this, we expect that the discretization of the biharmonic equation will maintain this second- order accuracy, which is verified by calculating the rate-of-convergence of the test. 4.

In this work we make use of composition to form finite dif- ference stencils which can then be used to numerically evaluate derivatives and solve partial differential equations. In stencil composition, two stencils with arbitrary derivative-orders are composed to obtain a stencil with a derivative-order equal to the sum of each individual sten- cil approximation. We represent stencils for various orders of derivative as stencil vectors, with the elements being the coefficients of the truncation error terms, allowing for the deter- mination of the leading-order error term of the composed stencil. We show that stencil com- position is associative and prove that the order-of-accuracy of the composed stencil will never fall', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03354v2'}),\n",

This method involves 2.5D blocking in space (2D blocking and streaming the third dimension), and 1D blocking in time.

Even though there are multiple implementations of application-specific high-order stencils on different hardware, few of them discuss general optimization of such stencils. One of the recent examples on GPUs by Tang et al. uses 2.5D spatial blocking (but no temporal blocking) and an “in-plane” optimization that allows them to achieve better memory alignment and coalescing compared to previous work, at the cost of extra redundant computation for each cell update [10].

On FPGAs, there is a large body of work on optimizing first- order stencils. The majority of recent examples of such work [14-17] employ temporal blocking to break away from the performance limit imposed by the low external memory bandwidth of modern FPGA boards, but they avoid using spatial blocking.

In this particular implementation, the coefficient for all the neighbors in a given direction is fixed; however, since we disallow reordering of floating-point operations, the coefficient is not shared and hence, the number of floating-point operations per cell update is equal to 12 × 𝑟𝑎𝑑 + 1 , with 6 × 𝑟𝑎𝑑 + 1 floating-point multiplications (FMUL) and 6 × 𝑟𝑎𝑑', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05983v1'}),\n",

The number of bytes per cell update is calculated with the assumption of full spatial reuse (no redundant memory accesses). It is evident from the table that the stencil FLOP to byte ratio increases with its radius, which makes high-order stencils less memory-bound than lower order ones. B.

FPGA To tune performance on our FPGA platform, we first need to calculate the number of DSPs that are needed to implement each cell update. On the Arria 10 FPGA, each DSP is capable of performing one Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) operation.

Because of this, DSP utilization will only be reduced by one per cell update, since still one DSP will be required whether the operation is FMA or FADD. Since the Arria 10 GX 1150 FPGA has 1518 DSPs, we can calculate the total degree of parallelism as: ⌊ 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = { ⌊ 1518 4×𝑟𝑎𝑑+1 1518 6×𝑟𝑎𝑑+1 ⌋ 2𝐷 ⌋ 3𝐷 (\\uf034) Then we have: 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 × 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑐 ≤ 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 (\\uf035) Here, 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 and 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑐 refer to degree of temporal parallelism (equal to numbers of replicated PEs) and vector size, respectively.

Then, we extract the top few (usually two) best-performing configurations chosen by our model, and place and route them. Going from first-order to high-order, we expect the size of the shift register per PE, and consequently, the amount of necessary on-chip memory, to proportionally increase with respect to radius.

We expect this to decrease the number of updated cells per second (GCell/s) proportional to radius, but keep the compute performance (GFLOP/s) nearly the same for all orders since FLOP per cell update increases proportional to radius.

On FPGAs, the trend is different: we can claim the performance we have achieved resembles a compute- bound scenario. Even though the level of the achieved compute performance (GFLOP/s) is far from the peak reported in Table II for the Arria 10 device, we emphasize that this peak can only be achieved with full utilization of all DSPs with FMA operations running at the peak operating frequency of the DSPs (~475 MHz) [24].

This way, the achievable peak performance is effectively reduced to ~660 GFLOP/s. Out of this peak performance, close to 40% is lost due to pipeline and memory controller inefficiency, and the remaining difference with the achieved performance is due to redundant computation to support overlapped blocking.

In their case, since temporal blocking is not employed, the roofline of the performance they can achieve in practice is only 0.8 GCell/s.

Application of stencils involves placing a thin sheet against a ﬂat surface, and spray-painting through the holes in the sheet. These stencils have been generated by hand as well as using image editing applications like Adobe Photoshop. Recently, the genera- tion of stencils has been automated [Jain et al. 2015]. By segment- ing images into piecewise constant layers using the Graph Cut Al- gorithm and ﬁxing the topology [Chen et al. 2011], an arbitrary im- age can be decomposed into a series of stencils, with one color as- signed per layer. We implement this system in MATLAB (see Fig- ure 2). We observe that such stencils are limited to hard-boundaries and only a ﬁnite number of colors; the ﬁnal composite cannot cap- ture the millions of colors present in the input image.

Future work would include printing and spray-painting the physical stencils, and comparing the composites with the input and simulated images.

It restructures a loop such that it processes the iteration space block-by-block and it constructs tiles that access most of the array elements often and in the same order in which they reside in memory, i.e., with temporal and spatial locality. There have been attempts to offload codes to FPGAs, i.e., to use a hardware synthesis (HLS) to generate circuits for them on the FPGA. However, out of the box tiled loops [12, 30] in general do not turn into efficient FPGA circuits. There are two main obstacles. First, the HLS cannot turn the tiled loop into hardware pipelines (as the loop boundaries and increments are too complex for the HLS to detect patterns).

Second, on CPUs or GPUs tiled loops run faster since their data locality exploits the built-in cache hierarchy. As on FPGAs there are no caches, there is no benefit from tiling alone. In general, the HLS generates from the tiled loop a hardware block (kernel) with connections to an FPGA bus through which the kernel directly talks to the DDR, i.e., with- out any host-side cache support. There are two approaches IMPACT 2024, January 17, 2024, Munich, Germany . to still allow loop tiles to enjoy data locality.

Loop Tiling Example. On CPUs/GPUs the purpose of tiling is to enhance cache locality. When the code accesses a memory address, the built- in cache hardware loads a full line that also includes adjacent addresses. In the ideal case, the tile size fits to the size of the cache lines and when a tile loop accesses an address in its first iteration, the cache hardware pre-loads all the data that later iterations of the tile need for faster accesses without cache-misses. However, this effect is only visible if the boundaries of the tiles are properly aligned w.r.t. the addressing requirements of the cache hardware.

Hence, in addition to picking a tile size, the optimizing compiler also picks a Δ that (slightly) shifts the boundaries of the tile loops, i.e., the first tile starts Δ iterations later and is shorter by Δ iterations. The inner tiles keep their sizes. The last tile grows by Δ iterations. In Fig. 1 the Tiling 1 does not have such a shift (Δ = 0). The second one uses Δ = 1. Such a shifting of the tile boundaries is important when targeting an architecture with built-in cache hardware. However, when targeting an FPGA, it is necessary to generalize the concept of shifting to both the outer and the inner loop. This turns Δ into a vector 𝛿 = (𝛿𝑜, 𝛿𝑖 ).

The fundamental idea of our approach is to use a stencil-specific cache buffer that holds all the data elements that a single tile needs, i.e., that – for a fixed set of loop indices of the 𝑑 outer loops – all iterations of the 𝑑 inner loops of a tiling access. We call these data elements the working set of a tile. Such a cache can improve the total runtime of a tile because of two reasons: First, it may be possible to apply an efficient burst load to fill the cache (spatial locality) before the tile starts its execution and to then serve the tile with faster accesses to the cached data instead of accesses to the copies residing in the DDR and, second, to benefit even more if the', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13645v1'}),\n",

At this point there is only the min-operation left that keeps the HLS from generating unrolled parallel circuits for the innermost tile loop. There are two approaches to get rid of this. One option is to use index set splitting on the outer loop so that (a) all the full tiles have the same fixed num- ber of iterations and can hence be unrolled, while (b) the incomplete last tile is cut off and processed separately.

Halv- ing the sizes in each dimension (= small tiles) causes the speedup to drop significantly, by a factor of 1.3× to 2.5×. Larger tiles are better because of two main reasons.

Second, the un- rolled basic blocks lead to bigger/deeper pipelines that can better hide memory latencies. Theoretically this can explain a factor of 2×. The range we see in the numbers is caused by both the number/sizes of the cache buffers and the amount of reuse. The data must be loaded into the buffers before the tiles access it.

For full buffers and, because of the pre-loading, even for chunk buffers, each load has a fixed runtime overhead. The more often the tile uses a data in the buffer, the better it can amortize these fixed costs. This explains why we see factors around 2x for the high- point stencils.

We remark here that this initial condition is taken as the one used for the µCH equation with smooth periodic waves in the form of u(x, t) = φ(x − ct), due to the lack of examples for the µDP equation with smooth traveling waves. We set M = 1.5, m = 0.5, and c = 2. This setting leads to a smooth periodic traveling wave of the µCH equation with period Tp = 2.73321849515629. µ0 can be further obtained with µ0 = 2.55499933801271.

We ﬁrst rewrite the DP equation as a hyperbolic-elliptic system and the µDP equation as a ﬁrst order system, by introducing auxiliary variable(s). Then 38 suitable numerical ﬂuxes are chosen to ensure stability and correct upwinding. For the numerical ﬂuxes of the auxiliary variable(s), we choose a linear ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme to approximate them with suitable order of accuracy. For the numerical ﬂuxes of the primal variable, we adopt two ﬁnite WENO procedures with unequal-sized sub-stencils for the reconstruction, i.e. the simple ﬁnite diﬀerence WENO procedure [47, 49] or the multi-resolution WENO procedure [49, 50, 51]. The simple WENO procedure uses one large stencil and several smaller stencils, while the multi-', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13910v2'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='the simple ﬁnite diﬀerence WENO procedure [47, 49] or the multi-resolution WENO procedure [49, 50, 51]. The simple WENO procedure uses one large stencil and several smaller stencils, while the multi- resolution WENO procedure uses a hierarchy of nested central stencils. in which all stencils are central and if the large stencil has 7 cells, then the following smaller stencils have 5, 3 and 1 cell(s), respectively. Comparing with the classical WENO procedure, both WENO procedures with unequal-sized choose linear weights to be any positive number on the condition that their sum is one. They provide a simpler way for WENO reconstruction. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that our proposed schemes can achieve high order accuracy in smooth regions, and resolve shocks or peakons sharply and in an essentially non-oscillatory fashion.

       " Document(page_content='[17], [18], [19], [22], [23]. We discuss the most related efforts below. Time skewing [7], [8] accelerates stencil computations by increasing data reuse and cache locality by skewing one or more data dimensions by the time dimension so that several time steps can be computed for a tile while values are in cache. It has been widely used on CPUs, e.g., [9], [10], and [11]. Overlapped tiling uses time skewing to increase the arith- metic intensity of parallel stencil computations by trading redundant computation along the boundaries of overlapped tiles for a reduction in memory bandwidth required [12], [13]. Overlapped tiling is effective on GPUs because loading data from a GPU’s global memory is much more costly than data- parallel computation. Furthermore, redundant computation can be overlapped with data accesses to help hide memory latency.

While overlapped tiling has been shown to improve the performance of low-order stencils on GPUs, for high-order stencils, redundant computation grows quickly when skewed across multiple time steps by the width of a high-order stencil. Split tiling [14] is an alternate approach for accelerating computation with time skewing. Rather than using overlapped tiles, which can introduce large amounts of redundant com- putation, split tiling computes points in two phases. The ﬁrst phase computes tiles in parallel as hypertrapezoids that taper along the time dimension. Once all tiles from the ﬁrst phase have been computed, a second phase back-ﬁlls the missing points in the time dimension.

Rather than computing the result for a point as a single computation, the semi-stencil algorithm divides computation along one or more axes into two halves. While sweeping along a dimension, it computes the ﬁnal result for one point and a partial result for another point a half-stencil width ahead. Compared to the traditional implementation of stencils, this approach changes the load/store ratio for the computation by trading half of the loads along a dimension for a store and a reload of a partial result. On a GPU, this has the potential for nearly halving the cache footprint of a thread block for a high-order stencil. Nguyen et al.

As a result, GPU computations must be structured differently than CPU computations to achieve high performance. First, the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Thread (SIMT) execution model used by GPUs differs signiﬁcantly from the execution model on CPUs. On NVIDIA GPUs, the execution model is realized by scheduling groups of 32 SIMT threads known as warps.

Finally, on NVIDIA GPUs, one could realize coarse-grain parallelism across Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) by partitioning the computation into a sufﬁcient number of blocks to keep the SMs busy. We experimented with three decomposition strategies based on our data domain and boundary conditions. First, we developed a single kernel that could be applied to any region of the data domain.

Blocking Strategies For each of the seven regions, we further slice it into smaller blocks, so that each block can ﬁt into GPU’s resources for each kernel launch.

IMPLEMENTATIONS In describing our implementations, we use R to denote the width of the halo, which is half the spatial order of the stencil. For the acoustic isotropic simulations in our experiments, R is 4. Let N x, N y, and N z denote the extents of the input data region along the X, Y , and Z axes, respectively.

Because we launch each kernel with a thread block of the same size, the total number of points must be ≤ 1024 to respect the GPU limit of at most 1024 threads per block.

For high-order stencils, the halo accounts for a signiﬁcant fraction of the data to fetch into shared memory. Thus, designing the right approach to minimize the fetch cost is crucial to overall performance. We describe the most general approach with good performance based on our experiments. First, thread (i, j, k) fetches the point (i, j, k).

Considering that maximum number of threads in a block is 1024 and the total amount of shared memory per block, the only possible tile size for this case is 8 × 8 × 8. This results in perfectly balanced fetch work and computation for threads along each dimension.

In fact, the halo size of eta is just one. Such low-order stencils have been widely studied in the literature; however, the combination of high and low order stencils is seldom addressed. Second, this implementation gives us an opportunity to observe the performance changes by using global memory with a good access pattern for a high-order stencil, meanwhile using shared memory for a lower-order stencil.

For 8 × 8 × 8 3D blocks, because 6/8 threads perform the fetching, in theory, we reduce thread idleness to just 20%. However, this algorithm has relatively complex arithmetic to tilt each thread to its proper halo position, so an experimental evaluation is needed to see whether the strategy is proﬁtable. 4) Semi-stencil: Semi-stencil was initially introduced for CPUs, where it separates the stencil computations into two phases, namely the forward phase and the backward phase.

Backward phases then compute as if the points are the right side of the stencil, and write out the ﬁnal result to the leftmost point. By doing this, semi-stencil has the potential to improve performance by changing the ratio between load and store. For example, for a 3D stencil of halo size of R, with typical approach, it requires to load 6 ∗ R + 1 points in order to perform stencil computation for one point. Once the computation is done, a single store writes the result back. So the load-store-ratio is (6 ∗ R + 1) : 1. On the other hand, using semi-stencil on one dimension, we read the center point and the half points with R + 1 loads, then forward phase writes one store, and backward phase write another store, thus total of two stores.', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04619v2'}),\n",

Therefore, the load-store-ratio for semi-stencil is (R + 1) : 2. Also please note that, even for multi-dimensions, this ratio does not change. This is in theory very appealing for high-order stencils because the larger the size of the halo, the potential beneﬁts one might achieve as the algorithm trades half of loads with just one more store. Therefore, we try to adopt semi-stencil algorithm on GPUs. We assign the identiﬁer semi to this implementation. 5) 2.5D Streaming with Multi-Plane using Shared Memory: Starting from this implementation, we use 2.5D blocking.

Alternatively, one can store data for stencil points along the streaming dimension in registers. We discuss two approaches that use registers to store points along the streaming dimension in the following sections. 6) 2.5D Streaming using Register Shifting: In this 2.5D streaming approach, we keep points of the current XY- subplane in shared memory.

Comparing the performance of the 3D kernel across GPU generations, we notice its poor performance portability. It is one of the slowest implementations on P100 and the NVS510.

Our results show that, gmem_8x8x8 is the best among them. We need to load all halos before performing stencil computations. For blocks smaller than gmem_8x8x8, such as gmem_4x4x4 and gmem_8x8x4, the halo size for our 25-point stencil dominates the actual data points. Therefore, more time is spent on loading halos than points for the volume to be computed, which hurts performance. In addition, smaller block sizes also result in larger GPU grid size as we can see from Table III, which means more kernel launches. For the smaller blocks, the additional overheads slow the overall execution. On the other hand, we also see performance degradation for larger blocks, gmem_16x16x4 and gmem_32x32x1.

Table IV shows that the 3D kernels using larger blocks, especially gmem_32x32x1, incur more L2 cache misses, which increases the number of high-latency loads from global memory. Table II shows that using shared memory can boost per- formance.

The overhead of using shared memory on V100 in 3D blocking erases this gain. In contrast, older generation GPUs do not have this new feature, so shared memory provides more performance beneﬁts than its overhead.

First, a larger 2D plane means a higher degree of concurrency. Second, with a larger plane, the percentage of halo points fetched into shared memory is smaller, which speeds up the overall performance. In addition, our results show that st_reg_shft_32x16 runs faster than st_reg_shft_16x32. From Table IV, we see more L2 transactions with st_reg_shft_16x32, which in turn harms performance.

Register Footprint in 2.5D-Blockings: However, although register spilling happens to the register shifting kernels, for the st_fixed_reg_32x32 kernel, we don’t see a performance degradation because the code uses ﬁxed registers with loop unrolling. Because the registers are ﬁxed, the frequency of register data movement is smaller than for kernels using the register shifting approach. This allows the performance impacted by register spilling to be hidden by other thread activities.

The performance degradation is caused by register spilling. The maximum registers in a blockthread is 64∗1024 = 65536. Because we have 1024 threads for these implementations, we can only have maximum 64 registers for each thread. If we do not explicitly specify the register count to nvcc, it assigns 80 and 96 registers to the PML and inner kernels, respectively. Running the generated binaries for these register footprints yields incorrect results. To avoid this problem, we use compiler ﬂag -maxrregcount=64 to limit the maximum register usage per thread. Unfortunately 64 registers are not enough to hold all of the variables at the same time, causing register spilling. The register shifting approach exacerbates register spilling due to its high frequency of register access. 2D plane of st_reg_shft_32x32, 1024, Performance Portability: The best performing', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04619v2'}),\n",

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we evaluated the performance of high-order stencils with boundary conditions. We reviewed the existing techniques for implementing 3D stencil computations and evaluated most of them suitable for high-order stencils, with the notable exception of time-skewing algorithms.

Inefﬁciency caused by branch divergence led us to apply domain decomposition and compute the boundaries sep- arate from the center region. While this improved efﬁciency, having the regions separate impedes our ability to apply time skewing along the streaming dimension for the 2.5D algorithm. We plan to reintegrate boundary computations with the inner region to enable us to evaluate 3.5D algorithms on high-order stencils by adding time skewing to the streaming dimension. In addition, we would like to explore whether applying the semi-stencil algorithm [15] along the streaming dimension to reduce the memory hierarchy footprint of a block’s stencil calculations and increase the arithmetic intensity of high-order kernels.

We recognize that implementing, tuning, maintaining, and porting high-performance GPU kernels for high-order stencils is quite difﬁcult. For the long term, we believe that a high-level representation of stencil computations in conjunction with powerful compiler technology is arguably the best strategy to improve development productivity and performance portability while also lowering maintenance costs by reducing complexity.

An in-cache grid point may be reused to update all its neighbors before evicted from the cache. However, the locality exploited by space blocking is limited by the neighbor pattern size of a stencil.

It turns to put the points with read-read depen- dencies in the same position of different vectors. Specifically, the original one-dimensional array of length 𝑁 is viewed as a matrix of size 𝑣𝑙 ∗(𝑁 ⇑𝑣𝑙). It then performs a matrix transpose.

The DLT generates an optimal in-core data access pattern while hurts the data locality in the cache. The sequential DLT results [13] exhibit performance improvements for all stencils when the data fit in caches. However, the DLT with a blocking scheme [14] derives considerable speedups for 1D stencils but only competitive or even worse performance for high-dimensional stencils. This implies that the degradation of data locality overweights the benefits of the vectorization for the DLT. We seek to design a vectorization scheme that maintains the data reuse ability and incurs a lightweight in-core data reorganizations simultaneously.

Compared with the data reorganization approach, the number of data reorganization operations in our method is fixed and irrelevant to the vector length, the stencil order, and dimensionality. With the double-stride optimization, the temporal vectorization incurs 0.75 lane-crossing and 2 in-lane instructions. The data reorganization vectorization needs 1 lane-crossing and 2 in-lane instructions for the 1D3P stencil and more for higher-order and dimension stencils. Compared with the DLT method, the temporal vectoriza- tion gives rise to a better reuse of the data in cache. Though the temporal vectorization also incorporates data transpose operations, it only processes a small set of points and the overhead can be amortized by stencil calculations.

The temporal vectorization, data reorganization approach, and DLT methods achieve the same reuse pattern to the scalar code. For example, it only needs to load one input vec- tor to compute an output vector for the 1D3P stencil. Thus the memory transfer volumes of their blocking implementa- tions are also similar. However, the temporal vectorization leads to slower transfer speed. Specifically, the straightfor- ward vectorization method touches all the input points in the data space in one time step while the temporal vectoriza- tion loads these data in four time steps. It can then expect less memory bandwidth contention, especially in multi-core executions.

Therefore the memory transfer volume is reduced by a factor of 2 for Jacobi stencils. The temporal vectorization would be represented with a set of loop transformations, i.e. the strip-mining of the time loop, the time skewing of the inner time loop and outermost space loop, the loop-peel and finally the outer-loop vector- ization.

The reduce part is typically realised as a sequence of partial GPU-side reduces, followed by a global host-side reduce. Thanks to GPUs’ globally shared memory, a map computation can implement a stencil as a data overlay with non-empty intersection, provided they are accessed in read-only fashion to enforce deterministic behaviour. Often, this kind of kernel is iteratively called in host code in a loop body up to a convergence criterion. Data parallelism has been provided to application programmers by way of various code artefacts (constructs, from now on) in both shared-memory and message-passing programming models (e.g. compiler directives, skeleton frameworks, pattern libraries).

Constructs in each tier can be composed and data parallel con- structs can be nested within stream parallel ones. The proposed approach distinguishes itself from nesting of task and data parallelism, which has been proposed (with various degrees of integration) as a way to integrate diﬀerent platforms: examples include MPI+OpenMP, OmpSs+SkePU, MPI+CUDA.

Nevertheless, from a computational perspective the diﬀerence is substantial, since the semantics of the map leads to in-place implementation, which is in general impossible for stencil.

The restoration phase is based on a 2D-stencil regularisation procedure, which replaces each pixel with the value minimising a function of the pixel neighbourhood. The termination is decided on a simple convergence criterion, based on the average absolute diﬀerence between two partial solutions at successive iterations, compared against a global threshold. We implemented the application by modelling it with the FastFlow pat- tern: pipe(read, detect, ofarm(restore), write), where restore is the Loop-of- stencil-reduce implementation of the restoration procedure and ofarm(a) is a pattern in which input items are processed in parallel by multiple instances of the a pattern and the order is preserved', metadata={'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04567v1'}),\n",

Furthermore, we showed that various iterative kernels can be easily and eﬀectively parallelised by using the Loop-of-stencil-reduce on the available GPUs by exploiting the OpenCL capabilities of the FastFlow parallel framework. We have focused here on capturing stencil iteration as a pattern, and on its integration in the established FastFlow pattern framework.

       " Document(page_content='compared to least squares approaches in terms of accuracy and com- putational performance. 1 Introduction The numerical approximation of the Poisson equation is a fundamental task encountered in many applications. Often it appears as a subproblem in a more complex computation, for instance as a projection step in the simu- lation of incompressible ﬂows [1]. Finite diﬀerence methods approximate the equation on a ﬁnite number of points. If the points can be placed on a regular grid, the approximation is simple and yields symmetric matrices. However, in many cases a regular point distribution is not possible or de- sired. Examples are the explicit representation of complex geometries, or the point positions may be given by the application, for instance from scattered measurements or in particle methods [8]. If the points are distributed irreg- ularly, neighborhood relations have to be established. This could be done by 1 constructing a mesh.

In this case, the stencil s = V − elimination, or by formulas for the determinant of a multivariate Vander- monde matrix [12]. If the points are not in general conﬁguration, e.g. for regular grids, the above rules may fail. A solution can exist for m < k (e.g. 5-point stencil in 2d), and no solution may exist for m > k (see exam- ple in [15, p. 59]). The concept of general conﬁguration is unhandy and too strict. Solutions may be acceptable, even if V does not have full rank. The geometric condition presented in Sect. 6 ensures the existence of stencils. 1 2.2 Minimal and Positive Stencils Deﬁnition 2.

A consistent stencil (s0, . . . , sm) is called minimal, if m Minimal stencils are beneﬁcial for the sparsity of the system matrix, resulting in a lower memory consumption and a faster solution of system (2). The total number of neighboring points is proportional to the eﬀort of applying the matrix to a vector, which is proportional to the time for one step of a (semi-)iterative linear solver. Of course, the few neighbors have to be chosen wisely, to preserve good convergence rates of iterative solvers. The results in [16, 17] indicate that this is the case with the presented approach. Remark 1. For minimal stencils, it is impossible that the stencil values de- pend continuously on the point positions.

Consider a con- tinuous movement of one of the neighbors and the sixth point, such that at the end these two points have swapped their positions, without them ever being in the same place. At some instance during this movement, the sixth point has to become a neighbor, resulting in a jump in the stencil values. Remark 2. If used in a particle method, the lack of smoothness in minimal stencils (Rem. 1) may lead to a non-conservative scheme. In an isolated Poisson solver and in particle methods that are not conservative by con- struction (such as the ﬁnite pointset method [8]) the advantage of optimal sparsity often outweighs this drawback. 4 ≤ k.

The de- sirability of positive stencils has been pointed out by Demkowicz, Karaﬁat and Liszka [2]. Classical approaches do in general not yield positive stencils. An “optimal star selection” [3] makes positive stencils likely, but they are not guaranteed (see Fig. 5). F¨urst and Sonar derive topological conditions on point clouds for positive least squares stencils in 1d [6]. In Sect. 5 we present a strategy that approximates the Poisson equation (1) on a point cloud by minimal positive stencils. In Sect. 6 conditions on a point cloud are presented (in 2d and 3d) which guarantee the existence of positive stencils. 3 M-Matrices Meshfree ﬁnite diﬀerence matrices are in general non-symmetric.

Problem (10) is a linear program (LP) in standard form. It is bounded, since we have imposed sign constraints and the weights wi are all non-negative. Theorem 5. If the polyhedron (9) is nonvoid, then the linear minimization approach (10) yields minimal positive stencils. Proof. The sign constraints in (10) ensure that the selected stencil is positive. The existence of a minimal solution is ensured by the fundamental theorem of linear programming [19].

Remark 5. One could ask why not remain with a least squares problem, and additionally impose sign constraints. While this would be a valid approach (the solution is obtained by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker methods [19]), it would have the worst of both worlds. The solution would not depend continu- ously on the point cloud geometry whenever the sign constraints are active, and the resulting stencil would not be minimal.

To our knowledge, there are no general results about eﬃcient methods for such small LPs, especially considering the special structure of the Vandermonde matrix. A numerical comparison of various methods has been presented in [15, p. 148]. Simplex methods perform best for the arising LPs. A basis change corresponds to one stencil point replacing another.

The aim of this process is to accurately deposit the correct amount onto each of the pads to be soldered. This is achieved by screen-printing the solder paste through a stencil or foil but also can be applied by jet printing. It is widely believed that this part of the process, if not controlled correctly, accounts for the majority of assembly defects. The most common method of applying solder paste to a PCB using a stencil printer is squeegee blade printing – see images below. The squeegees are the tools used to apply the necessary force required to move the solder paste across the stencil and on to the PCB. They are usually made from metal but can\n",

They are usually made from metal but can also be made from polyurethane. Solder Paste Transfer Efficiency The solder paste's transfer efficiency from the stencil to the board during the printing process is determined by a number of variables. Below is a Ishikawa diagram listing many of the variables in the printing process that can affect the transfer efficiency. Considerations The key parameters of an effective solder paste printing process are as follows:- Stencil design Squeegee speed Squeegee pressure Squeegee angle Snap-Off/Print gap Stencil separation speed Stencil cleaning Stencil and squeegee condition PCB support Print stroke Type, storage and handling Inspection (2D/3D) CLICK HERE FOR CENTROID FILE GENERATION 1) Stencil Design A stencil is a thin sheet of material (typically stainless steel) with a series of apertures\n",

The function of the solder paste stencil is to accurately deposit the correct amount of solder paste onto the surface mount pads so that the solder joint between PCB pad and component terminal are acceptable with regard to the electrical connection and mechanical strength. LEARN ABOUT STENCIL DESIGN 2) Squeegee Speed The speed of travel of the squeegee determines how much time is available for the solder paste to “roll” into the apertures of the stencil and onto the pads of the PCB.

LEARN MORE ABOUT SQUEEGEE SPEED 3) Squeegee Pressure During the print cycle it is important to apply sufficient pressure across the entire length of the squeegee blade to ensure a clean wipe of the stencil. Too little pressure can cause “smearing” of the paste on the stencil, poor deposition, and the incomplete transfer to the PCB. Too much pressure can cause “ scooping” of the paste from larger apertures, excess wear on the stencil and squeegees, and may cause “ bleeding” of the paste between the stencil and PCB. A typical setting for the squeegee pressure is 500 grams of pressure per 25mm of squeegee blade.

If the angle is increased it can cause ‘ scooping’ of the solder paste from the stencil apertures and so less solder paste to be deposited. If the angle is reduced it can cause a residue of solder paste to be left on the stencil after the squeegee has completed a print. Effect of squeegee angle 5) Snap-Off / Print Gap The 'Snap-off' or 'Print Gap' is the distance between the top side of the PCB and the bottom side of the stencil. Although there maybe some advantages of printing with a snap-off, it is generally recommended to use 'On-Contact' printing or 'Zero-Gap' as this process allows a complete gasket between the stencil and PCB. This is particularly important for printing fine-pitch components such as QFP's to reduce the risk of solder ' bridging' and solder ' bleeding'.

A speed setting of up to 3mm per second should be used and is governed by the size of the apertures within the stencil. If this is too fast it will cause the solder paste to not fully release from the apertures and the formation of high edges around the deposits also known as “ dog-ears” which can be seen below.

If the PCB is not fully supported it can lead to printing defects such as a poor paste deposit and smudging. PCB supports are generally supplied with printing machines which are a fixed height and have programmable positions to ensure a consistent process. There are also adaptable PCB supports available of varying designs which mould themselves to the PCB and are useful for double sided assemblies. Example of adaptable PCB support in use 10) Print Stroke This is the distance the squeegee travels across the stencil and is recommended to be a minimum of 20mm past the furthest aperture.

A term often used is the ‘Rheology’ of the solder paste which describes how the solder paste forms a block when no energy is applied but changes to a more fluid material when energy is applied. The correct type of solder paste should be selected based upon the size of the apertures within the stencil. The release from the apertures of the stencil is affected by the particle size within the selected solder paste. Below are the particle sizes\n",

Both Tin-Lead and Lead-Free solder paste should be refrigerated while being stored to maintain its shelf life but must be brought to room temperature for a minimum of eight hours before use to maintain quality. The solder paste should be mixed before use to ensure even distribution of any separated material throughout the paste.

There are two types of solder paste inspection available which are 2D inspection which checks the area of the paste deposit and 3D inspection which checks the volume of the paste deposit - See ' Solder Paste Inspection Process' for more detail.

The settings for printing low temperature lead free solder paste can be quite different and if not set correctly will cause poor print definition. Print speeds should be much faster than conventional solder pastes ranging from 50mm per second up to 100mm per second. Squeegee pressure needs to be less than conventional solder pastes with the recommendation to apply no more pressure than is needed to get a clean stencil while printing – the setting will be nearer to 300 grams of pressure per 25mm of squeegee blade. Another factor that needs to be considered is the amount of solder paste put on the stencil. Low temperature lead free solder paste tends to stick to the squeegee blades during use due to being lighter in weight as contains less tin.

It is therefore recommended to apply more paste than with conventional solder to encourage the paste to remain on the stencil in a continuous bead. Conclusion The solder paste printing stage of the assembly process is vitally important. If there are errors introduced at this stage there will be “knock on” effects throughout the process. To develop the optimum solder paste printing process it is essential to consider all aspects of the process detailed above. An Increase in Efficiency and Productivity It’s a shocking statistic to read that within the electronics industry many surface mount operations, particularly within the sub-contract manufacturing sector, run as low as 20% efficient.

      "reasons that contribute to this figure but it fundamentally means that only 20% of the capital investment is being utilized. Financially speaking, this will lead to a higher cost of ownership and a slower return on investment. For the customer, it can cause longer lead times for their product and therefore the business will not be as competitive in the market place. With production efficiencies at this level there will be many knock-on effects that will have an impact on the business such as larger batch sizes, more parts in stock, more assemblies in WIP (work in progress) and slower reaction times to customer change requirements. With all this in mind there is a strong incentive to improve efficiency while maintaining quality.

      "many prints you can undergo before it is necessary to clean the stencil. It depends on several factors. If the initial setup is off, then you will need to wipe more often. If the humidity and/or room temperature are too high, the paste will tend to slump and smear more easily, and you will need to wipe more often. If there are excessive HASL deposits near the apertures that prevent good gasketing between the stencil and the PWB, you will have some paste squeeze-out and will need to wipe more often. If the squeegee pressure is too high, the same squeeze-out can occur. If separation of the flux and solids happens (inadequate mixing or poor quality paste) the flux will squeeze out onto the stencil and prevent a clean snap off. The more apertures in the stencil, the more chances for issues; some boards will need to be cleaned at a higher frequency than others. Old paste will tend to be of a higher viscosity(dried out) and you will see more aperture clogs. On the other hand,excessively\n",

      "some boards will need to be cleaned at a higher frequency than others. Old paste will tend to be of a higher viscosity(dried out) and you will see more aperture clogs. On the other hand,excessively sheared paste (printed several times back and forth on the stencil without replenishment) will lose viscosity and be more likely to have squeeze-out issues. There are a lot of reasons where you could find yourself having to clean after every print. With all of the variables under control, a good setup and good paste and a good environment (67 to 69 deg. F at 40-50%RH) you should be able to print at least 10 very complex PWBs before another wipe is required. As I have pointed out in several previous posts, there are a large number of variables that must be controlled in both the paste handling and printing processes. If they are not controlled poor printing results, as well as more frequent cleaning of the stencil between prints. This is why the controls over both the material(paste), the\n",

Take the time to ensure you have control over the variables from the time the paste hits the dock all the way through the printing process; every minute invested in that endeavor will pay off at least 60 times in lost production time and rework hours and prematurely discarded solder paste.

      "under stencil wipe, there is no standard. It is very process dependent. A good practice is a dry wipe every 6 to 10 prints. If you find that you have to wipe more frequently and/or use a solvent wipe followed by a vacuum cycle, that is a good indication that something is wrong with the printer set-up; like poor gasketing.

This has raised the question, \"What are the optimal printer settings?\" This is difficult to answer due to the complexity of the process and the unique needs of each individual build. In other words, there is not a one-size-fits-all answer for this question. If there was, there wouldn’t be much of a need for highly-skilled process engineers.

      "for this question. If there was, there wouldn’t be much of a need for highly-skilled process engineers. Each product build should be optimized for the needs of the particular product being built. The only way to do so is to take the time before production begins and optimize each setting separately. Here is a list of the typical printer settings that influence the performance of the solder paste and the transfer efficiency and/or volumetric variability. Experiments can be performed to optimize each to achieve the best results for the product that is being built. Squeegee Speed: Depends on the solder paste being used and the line speed demands. Squeegee speeds should be optimized for each product so that the line speeds can be met and the best transfer efficiency of the paste is achieved. Typically the setting should be at the slowest speed the line throughput can manage.

      "Typically the setting should be at the slowest speed the line throughput can manage. Certain solder pastes were designed for faster squeegee speeds and can not only handle the higher speeds but the transfer efficiency performance is actually better at higher speeds. Build characteristics such as, but not limited to, board designs, stencil designs, throughput requirements, etc., may require slower or faster speeds. Squeegee Pressure: Should be optimized so that the least amount of pressure is used where the squeegees produce a clean wipe of the stencil. This will depend on the stencil being used, the squeegees (age, angle, flex, metal, etc…), and a number of other factors. Squeegee Length: should be approximately 1” longer than the area of the apertures on the stencil. Squeegee edge guards should be used to hold the paste within the printed area. Snap-Off Distance: Does not matter much as long as the solder paste clears the stencil. 2mm is a typical setting. Separation Speed: The print\n",

      "should be used to hold the paste within the printed area. Snap-Off Distance: Does not matter much as long as the solder paste clears the stencil. 2mm is a typical setting. Separation Speed: The print quality can be optimized with a small separation speed DOE. Small apertures will typically perform differently than large apertures with regard to transfer efficiency. Optimization should be performed considering the performance of the smaller apertures because these will be your most critical apertures for solder volume. Larger apertures typically have a higher tolerance for volume variability. Separation Delay: Can sometimes aid in transfer efficiency. A Separation delay can help because it gives the paste a bit more time to grab onto the board/pad before the board is pulled from the stencil. However, you could say the same for the stencil aperture walls. Unless a DOE proving there is a benefit is performed the separation delay should be left at 0 seconds. Print Gap: Should be set at\n",

      "However, you could say the same for the stencil aperture walls. Unless a DOE proving there is a benefit is performed the separation delay should be left at 0 seconds. Print Gap: Should be set at 0mm. If there is a need for a print gap there is something else in the printer and/or process that is not set-up or calibrated correctly. Offsets: Should be set at 0mm. If there is a need for an offset there is something else in the printer/process that is not set-up or calibrated correctly or the board was not built correctly. Under-Stencil Wipe Frequency: Should be optimized for the process/product requirements. If your printer set-up is inadequate you will have to wipe more frequently. It will also depend on the line throughput that is needed and the solder paste used in the process. Under-Stencil Wipe Type: This has been vastly debated. For many processes, a dry wipe is adequate.

      "Wipe Type: This has been vastly debated. For many processes, a dry wipe is adequate. Some people prefer a dry/vacuum or a wet/dry/vacuum wipe and there are a vast array of other possibilities. If a wet wipe is used the solvent that is being used should be compatible with the solder paste that is being used. Under-Stencil Wipe Solvent: This depends on the solder paste being used. It is absolutely necessary to discuss with the solder paste supplier and solvent supplier to make sure that the solvent will clean the solder paste from the stencil properly. Most cleaning solvent supplier will have run testing to determine the appropriate cleaning solvent for each solder paste. Optimize the process and then lock in the details for that specific process/product. Be careful locking yourself into too tight of a process though.

Whether it’s putting a man on the moon or breaking the 4-minute mile, challenges lead to innovation. Innovation in turn can result in advanced technologies, a better business and possibly a better bottom line. As technology continues to evolve, The SMT manufacturing industry is faced with new challenges every day. One such challenge stems from the increased use of jet printing solder paste in the SMT manufacturing process. Jet printing is becoming an industry standard due to its ability to meet a new era of production challenges. However, effectively cleaning jet printing solder paste residues post-soldering presents its own set of challenges.

      "presents its own set of challenges. Within the SMT manufacturing process, stencil printing is one of the most critical steps for depositing solder pastes. With that being said, stencil printing is regarded as a source for approx. 70% of soldering error (i.e. bridges, insufficients and opens). As PCB designs become more complex, limitations and difficulties of the stencil printing process have been realized. This is largely due to the boards being populated with an increasing number of very small components populated around very large components occupying a limited piece of real estate. Additionally, with stencil printing comes the need for stencils and underside wipe materials. Jet printing is gaining popularity because it provides high throughput with precision, offers a contactless and accurate depositing of the solder for specific components, and can eliminate the need for stencils and underside wiping materials.

      "accurate depositing of the solder for specific components, and can eliminate the need for stencils and underside wiping materials. Moreover, you can continue using the same CAD or Gerber file data which is used by pick and place machines. Lately, more companies are starting to use it as an add-on tool complementing the screen-printing process. Typically, jet printing uses type 5 and type 6 solder pastes which contain finer solder powder. The metal content of these pastes is reduced and the flux activity levels are increased to minimize the oxidation process. These factors make cleaning jet-printed solder paste more difficult than traditional screen-printed solder paste. Effectively cleaning jet printing solder paste means choosing the right combination of cleaning agent and machine cleaning process (either inline or batch cleaners) to ensure the reliability of jet printed designs.

There is evidence that an optimized cleaning process for a traditional screen-printing paste type may not produce the same results if an equivalent jettable solder paste is used instead. As manufacturers in today’s production environment continue to overcome challenges of all kinds, the challenge of effectively cleaning jet printing solder paste remains. The good news is, that with the right cleaning chemistry and fine-tuned cleaning process, that challenge can be met.

      "manufacturers use the smallest available packaging footprints. As a result, Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs) have become denser and more sophisticated than ever. The real challenge then becomes how to achieve consistency and reproducibility in the printing process of these sophisticated PCBs. To ensure consistency and reproducibility, the electronic manufacturers make use of stencils to deposit solder paste to PCBs. Inevitably, the condition of the stencil now becomes the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) governing the efficiency, consistency, and reproducibility of the PCB printing process. Almost 70% of defects in Surface Mount Technology (SMT) are attributed to imperfections in depositing solder paste. Therefore, it becomes imperative to study, improve, and monitor the stencil cleaning process.

To educate the readers, some standard stencil cleaning practices are mentioned. Finally, some products from Techspray are highlighted which aid process engineers in thorough stencil cleaning. Why Clean Stencils? A stencil is a metal sheet with tiny apertures used for depositing solder paste on PCB substrate in very small areas i.e., SMT pads. The squeegee presses the solder paste into the stencil apertures for proper deposition as shown in Figure 1. In the electronics industry, the cleanliness of PCB substrates has traditionally been a focus area, resulting in substantial profits for those manufacturers of PCB cleaning products.

      "What is often overlooked is the stencil cleaning process. What if the stencils are not properly cleaned before the stencil printing process? Dirty stencils would result in an undesirable volume of solder paste deposited to the SMT pad and this is categorized as a printing fault. A misprinted PCB could be disqualified during inspection requiring extra cost for repair and rework. In electronics manufacturing, around 40% of production time is wasted on debugging printing issues [1]. Some major issues caused by contaminated stencils include slumping, open solder joints, shifting, smearing, and solder bridging. To avoid such issues, it is mandatory to control the volume of solder paste transported to PCB pads, particularly for fine, ultra-fine, chip-scale, BGA, and flip-chip components. Technically, it is characterized by transfer efficiency (TE), which is defined as the ratio of the actual solder paste volume deposit to the volume of the corresponding aperture [1]. Ideally, TE should be\n",

      "it is characterized by transfer efficiency (TE), which is defined as the ratio of the actual solder paste volume deposit to the volume of the corresponding aperture [1]. Ideally, TE should be 100% but a TE of 70% is also acceptable. To maintain the desired value of TE, the stencil apertures must be properly cleaned and free of any leftover solder paste/residue. Figure 2 portrays an example of a stencil with clogged apertures. Figure 3 shows the negative impact of printing with clogged stencil apertures. Figure 1: Stencil printing process [2] Figure 2: A contaminated stencil [3] Figure 3: Open solder joints due to insufficient solder paste [3] Similarly, a stencil with residue on its bottom side will lead to inconsistent transfer of paste to the PCB pads. Leftover solder paste on the underside of the stencil gets transferred to the other board and causes bridging. Therefore, cleaning the stencil removes residue, decreases printing problems, and ensures the uniformity of the prints.\n",

Proper stencil cleaning makes the electronics manufacturing business more profitable as the need for rework is minimized. A little extra effort at the beginning of a process saves time and money in the long run. How To Maintain Stencil Cleanliness? Under Stencil Wiping: The stencil-printing machine often does the job of under-stencil wiping (dry, wet, or vacuum wipe). A cleaning solvent is used with a lint-free paper to remove the solder paste. To achieve the best cleaning results in under stencil wiping, the flux component must be dissolved within the solder paste. This eases the release of solder spheres which are then easily collected by wiping paper [4]. These printers also include a vacuum generator that sucks the contamination from the apertures. If the printer does not have such an\n",

      "spheres which are then easily collected by wiping paper [4]. These printers also include a vacuum generator that sucks the contamination from the apertures. If the printer does not have such an automated system, under stencil wiping can be performed manually using a pre-saturated lint-free wipe. However, manual stencil cleaning has its own drawbacks, which include risks to workers’ health, the risk of damage to the stencil itself, and the reliance on the operator’s experience. These drawbacks often outweigh what benefits there may be to manual cleaning. Ultrasonic Agitation: Ultrasonic agitation is performed by generating ultrasonic waves (40 kHz) in a liquid cleaning medium [3]. This process (called cavitation) forms bubbles in the liquid that reach even the tiny apertures of the stencil. The bubbling action provides the mechanical force to separate contaminants from the stencil. Higher frequencies can result in better cleaning but the exposure time to moisture increases which could\n",
      "-----------------------------------\n",
      "The bubbling action provides the mechanical force to separate contaminants from the stencil. Higher frequencies can result in better cleaning but the exposure time to moisture increases which could harm the stencil adhesive bonds. It is therefore a standard practice to use the “sweep” feature or multiple frequencies [3]. A key point is that the cleaning tank must be of stainless steel. Plastic tanks have the tendency to absorb ultrasonic waves and may render the cleaning process inefficient. Finally, the cleaning chemistry must be chosen properly. The cleaning agent must be compatible with the stencil material. The main advantage of ultrasonic cleaning is that there is no chance of damage to the stencil as 40 kHz vibrations are completely safe for the stencils. Moreover, this process takes less time to complete as compared to the manual cleaning process. Spray-In-Air Technology: As the name suggests, this technology uses a spray pump and nozzles to spray the washing solution onto the\n",

      "less time to complete as compared to the manual cleaning process. Spray-In-Air Technology: As the name suggests, this technology uses a spray pump and nozzles to spray the washing solution onto the stencil. The flux is placed in the solution resulting in solder balls lifting off the stencil [5]. The spray pressure must be high enough to remove all solder balls from the apertures and yet low enough to not damage the delicate stencils. Batch Stencil Cleaning: A short description of this process is already available in this article by Techspray. In the case of aqueous cleaning, a rise in temperature improves the effectiveness of the cleaning process and reduces cleaning time. However, too high a temperature (generally over 110oF) can delaminate stencil adhesive [3]. Too low a temperature increases exposure time to moisture which may reduce the strength of the adhesive bond and frame interface. Nano-Coatings: Besides ensuring reduced bridging problems and improved solder paste release,\n",

      "exposure time to moisture which may reduce the strength of the adhesive bond and frame interface. Nano-Coatings: Besides ensuring reduced bridging problems and improved solder paste release, nano-coatings are well known to reduce the need for underside cleaning of stencils. These coatings (1-100 nm thick) prevent spreading of solder paste on the underside of stencils. Basically, the nano-coatings are meant to provide the advantage of “fluxophobicity” i.e., it allows the solder paste to de-wet and be removed from the stencil easily [6]. The fluxophobicity can be estimated by measuring the contact angle. In [6], it has been experimentally proved that nano-coatings improve the contact angle as compared to uncoated stencils. The increase in contact angle is due to the de-wetting of the solder paste from the stencil underside. A visual comparison of a coated and uncoated stencil is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

However, before making the final decision, the process engineer must also consider the fact that nano-coatings can alter the properties of stencil material [2]. Another useful point to keep in mind is that nano-coatings perform well when the apertures are very small and the solder paste is dense.

Overdosing of cleaner solution worsens the cleaning result This means for a standard (linear) cleaning system, complete (gapless) wetting across the width of the fabric must be ensured.

INTRODUCTION According to a recent analysis, 50-70% of PCB defects occur during the solder printing step [1]. The solder paste printer (SPP) causes defects due to two factors: randomness and defects in the printer itself. SPI detects the PCB defects in advance and prevents a decrease in the throughput. SPI inspects each PCB by measuring the volume of the solder paste on each PCB pad. If the deposited solder paste is excessive, two or more pads are connected through the solder paste causing solder bridging. Conversely, if the deposited solder paste is insufﬁcient, the reliability of the solder joint deteriorates or electrical opens could appear. Therefore, SPP is designed to deposit solder paste on each pad within the\n",

      "the deposited solder paste is insufﬁcient, the reliability of the solder joint deteriorates or electrical opens could appear. Therefore, SPP is designed to deposit solder paste on each pad within the speciﬁcation limit of the solder paste volume. If the deposited volume of the pad is out of the speciﬁcation limit, SPI judges the pad as an excessive or insufﬁcient one. Traditionally, the decision thresholds for excessiveness and insufﬁciency are determined with the assumption that the deposited volumes on the pads with the same aperture shape follow a normal distribution. With the assumption, SPI groups the deposited pads by the same aperture shape, and calculates the mean and variance of the volumes per each group. Then, the pads whose solder paste volumes are far from the mean are regarded as anomaly pads. This approach, however, can hardly identify the PCB defects caused by the printer defects.

Smart factories collect the state data of sub-systems using IoT sensors and control sub-systems analyzing the collected data in real time. One of key technologies in smart factories is Surface Mount Technology (SMT) for automatic Printed Circuit Board (PCB) production. SMT in general consists of ﬁve steps: 1) solder paste printing, 2) solder paste inspection, 3) mounting chips, 4) chip alignment inspection and 5) reﬂow oven to attach chips to solder pastes. The process alternates between a task step and an inspection step, which is to guarantee a high throughput.

      "between a task step and an inspection step, which is to guarantee a high throughput. Smart factories represent To overcome the above-mentioned limitation, we propose a Convolutional Recurrent Reconstructive Network (CRRN) that detects anomaly pads without the normal distribution assumption. CRRN, as a type of convolutional recurrent au- toencoder (CRAE), consists of a spatial encoder (S-Encoder), a spatiotemporal encoder and decoder (ST-Encoder-Decoder), and a spatial decoder (S-Decoder). By training CRRN using only normal data, CRRN can reconstructs normal data even if it receives anomaly data. Thus, the anomaly map can be decomposed from the reconstruction error between the reconstructed data and the input data.

Anomaly Detection Anomaly detection can be classiﬁed into spatial anomaly detection, temporal anomaly detection, and spatiotemporal anomaly detection depending on the data types it handles.

Application areas of spatial anomaly detection include medicine and manufactur- ing. In the medical ﬁeld, anomaly detection highlights the disease regions in medical images [2], [3]. Anomaly detection in manufacturing identiﬁes defective parts of products using the product images [6], [7]. Next, temporal anomaly detection identiﬁes the anomaly regions in the time-varying data. One-class SVM [8] and recurrent auto-encoder (RAE) [9]–[13] are main algorithms used for the temporal anomaly detection.

By analyzing the trend of soldering, the stencil cleaning interval can be automati- cally optimized [23], [24]. Similarly, the optimization of SPP parameters improves the quality of the end-products [25]. In addition, there are studies diagnosing the quality of soldering and identifying soldering defects [26]–[28]. Their studies are to diagnose soldering states of a single PCB. However, there are limits to applying to the SPP diagnosis, since the patterns of the SPP defects may appear over multiple PCBs.

CHARACTERISTICS OF SPI DATA Several packages, mounted on the board, are ﬁxed to the board with the deposited solder paste. Thus, the position of the deposited solder paste should match the position of the metal pad in the package. As shown in Fig. 1, the SPI data, measuring the volume of the solder paste, contains a spatial pattern due to the different spatial locations of the packages and various shapes of pads. The solder paste volume of each pad depends on the package type. Moreover, even in the same package, the solder paste volume of each pad varies according to the relative position in the package. Also, SPI data display a temporal pattern in addition to the spatial pattern. The temporal pattern originates from two the\n",

The temporal pattern originates from two the stencil cleaning interval of SPP and the two factors: squeegee blades of SPP. Firstly, SPP regularly cleans up the residual solder paste of the stencil to prevent anomaly pads. During mass production of PCBs using SPP, residual solder paste accumulates beneath the stencil and inside the stencil apertures. The residual solder paste beneath the stencil causes a solder smudging problem and the residual solder paste inside the stencil apertures causes an aperture blockage problem. To resolve the problems, the stencil cleaning is periodically performed to remove the remaining solder paste and the periodic cleaning generates the temporal pattern of the SPI data.

CONVOLUTIONAL RECURRENT RECONSTRUCTIVE NETWORK In this section, we describe the proposed Convolutional Recurrent Reconstructive Network (CRRN) for anomaly de- tection in spatiotemporal data. Fig. 3 displays the overall architecture of CRRN. CRRN is a type of an encoder-decoder model. The encoder consists of a spatial encoder (S-Encoder) that extracts spatial features from the spatiotemporal input, and a spatiotemporal encoder (ST-Encoder) that extracts spa- tiotemporal features from a sequence of the spatial features. Similarly, the decoder of CRRN consists of an S-Encoder, a spatiotemporal decoder (ST-Decoder) that decodes spatial features of each timestep, and a spatial decoder (S-Decoder) that reconstructs the original data.

Spatial Encoder and Decoder The S-Encoder shown in Fig. 4(a), extracts the spatial feature, ˆXt ∈ RNc×Nh×Nw from the original spatial data, Xt ∈ RN in w , where Nc (N in h ), and Nw (N in w ) respectively denote the numbers of channel, height, and width of ˆXt (Xt). The S-Encoder contains multiple modules and each module consists of a convolution layer, a batch normalization layer, and a ReLU activation layer. The convolution layer converts high dimension feature maps into low dimension feature maps. The batch normalization prevents the covariance shift by normalizing the values of each layer [29]. The ReLU activation layer imposes non-linearity to enhance the modeling capability of CRRN. c ×N in h ×N in c ), Nh (N in The S-Decoder shown in Fig. 4(b), operates in the reverse manner compared to the S-Encoder.\n",

The deconvolution reconstructs a high dimensional feature maps from a low dimension feature maps. The last module of the S-Decoder does not include the ReLU activation layer, thus ensuring that the generated output has a valid range.

Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST- LSTM) is designed to facilitate the ﬂows of the spatiotem- poral information [16].

We add random noise to the inputs during the training phase. Moreover, we set a part of input elements to zero at the training phase. The denoising auto-encoder enhances the resilience of the original data without the noises [31]. 3) Spatiotemporal Attention Mechanism: As the length of the sequence increases, the number of hidden states to pass to reach from the hidden state of the encoder to the corre- sponding hidden state of the decoder increases. This causes long-term dependency problem. To resolve the problem, we propose a spatiotemporal attention (ST-Attention) mechanism that directly transmits the information of the corresponding hidden states between the encoder and decoder, regardless of the sequence length. The ST-Attention mechanism extracts the ST-Attention map that represents the feature of the hidden\n",

      "the corresponding hidden states between the encoder and decoder, regardless of the sequence length. The ST-Attention mechanism extracts the ST-Attention map that represents the feature of the hidden state of the encoder, and then reuses the ST-Attention map when generating the corresponding hidden state in the decoder. Since the ST-Attention map acts as a bridge between the encoder and the decoder, the proposed ST-Attention mechanism can effectively solve the long-term dependency problem. The procedure of the ST-Attention mechanism is shown in Fig. 6. The ST-Attention mechanism extracts the spatial feature of Et that affects the next hidden state, Et+1. For this, we deﬁne the ST-Attention map, At ∈ R1×Nh×Nw that is applied to the hidden state, Et before transmitting to next hidden state, Et+1 as follows: At = tanh(WA ∗ Et) where WA ∈ R1×Nc×Nk×Nk represents the weight matrices of the convolutional operation and Nk denotes the kernel size of the convolution. The hidden state, Et with Nc\n",
      "-----------------------------------\n",
      "as follows: At = tanh(WA ∗ Et) where WA ∈ R1×Nc×Nk×Nk represents the weight matrices of the convolutional operation and Nk denotes the kernel size of the convolution. The hidden state, Et with Nc channels is converted to the ST-Attention map, At with 1 channel. At is replicated in channel-wise manner to match the number of channels with that of Et. The replicated ST-Attention map, Arep t is applied to the hidden state, Et as follows: ˆEt = Et + Arep t . In the decoder, the ST-Attention map, At obtained in the encoder is applied to the hidden states in the reverse way. We from ˆDt and obtain Dt as follows: subtract Arep Dt = ˆDt − Arep t . t We reuse the At obtained from the encoder. Thus, At acts as a shortcut path between the encoder and the decoder. The reason for reversing the operation of the attention map in the encoder and decoder is to use the last hidden state of the encoder, ET as the initial hidden state of the decoder, DT .

      "of the attention map in the encoder and decoder is to use the last hidden state of the encoder, ET as the initial hidden state of the decoder, DT . The last hidden state, ET is a feature that contains global information of the input sequence. The longer the length of the sequence, the more difﬁcult for the ﬁxed-size hidden state to encode the information of the input sequence due to increased contexts. If the ST-Attention mechanism is applied, the local information of each input can be efﬁciently transmit- ted through the ST-Attention map, which makes the decoder directly access the corresponding ST-Attention map when generating each output. Since local information is captured in the ST-Attention map, global information can be captured intensively in the last hidden state of the encoder, Et. V.

An anomaly score, f (t) represents the degree of the defect respectively for squeegee blade defect, support defect, support defect, removal area of t (10) solder paste, solder no kneading, and clamp defect. f (t) is approximated as a scalar value for each time step as follows: f (t) = (cid:40) σ(10t/T − 5), 0, if t is odd, otherwise, f (t) = σ(10t/T − 5), f (t) = −σ(10t/T − 5), f (t) = 1 − σ(10t/T − 5), f (t) = σ(10t/T − 5) or − σ((10t/T − 5), where T is the total number of PCB products generated. The effects of defects were not noticeable in early PCB production, and as the production progresses, the effects of defects appeared in the SPI data. Thus, we approximated the anomaly score using the sigmoid function. Fig. 12 displays the proﬁle of the anomaly score, f (t) for each defect type over timestep (upper graph of each\n",

      "in the SPI data. Thus, we approximated the anomaly score using the sigmoid function. Fig. 12 displays the proﬁle of the anomaly score, f (t) for each defect type over timestep (upper graph of each subﬁgure). Using the selected threshold of the highest F1 score obtained from Experiment 1, we evaluated the recall for each timestep (lower graph of each subﬁgure). We compared CRRN with the statistical method. The larger the anomaly score, the easier the detection is, because the volumes of the anomaly pads become signiﬁcantly different from those of the normal pads. Thus, the recall ratio increases according to the increase of the anomaly score. In the statistical model, however, despite anomaly score increases, the recall tends to be saturated. This phenomenon is caused by the shift of the Gaussian distribution as described in Experiment 1. On the other hand, the recall of CRRN tends to increase as the anomaly score increases.

Since CRRN judges the anomaly by considering volumes of the whole pads, the performance is superior to the statistical method that judges the anomaly by using volumes of pads belonging to each group. Fig. 13 shows the results of anomaly map decomposition for each defect, and each sub-ﬁgure shows the original SPI data, the reconstructed outputs, and the reconstruction errors for each row from the top. The anomaly pattern in the anomaly map becomes clear with the increase of the anomaly score. C.

The excessive channel was obtained by max pooling to preserve excessive patterns. On the other hand, insufﬁcient channel was obtained through min pooling to preserve the insufﬁcient pat- tern. Each channel was binarized using the decision threshold used in Experiment 1. Fig. 14 shows the binarized channel for each defect where the excessive channel and insufﬁcient channel are marked in red and blue, respectively.

Since most of SPI data are normal, we trained CRRN using only normal SPI data. Using the trained CRRN, the anomaly map was decomposed from the SPI data with anomaly defects based on the reconstruction error. To verify the performance of CRRN, we compared CRRN with the statistical method and other deep learning- based methods. Through three experiments, we demonstrated the superior anomaly detection performance of CRRN to other methods. In addition, we proved that the anomaly map can be applied to the defect classiﬁcation of the SPP.

As part of this research we conducted thou- sands of automatic and manual printing protocol attacks on various printers and recorded thousands of the printers’ benign network sessions. Then we applied various supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify the collected data as normal (benign) or abnormal (malicious). We evaluated several detec- tion algorithms, feature selection methods, and the features needed in order to obtain the best detection results for protocol traffic of printers. Our empirical re- sults suggest that the proposed framework is effective in detecting printing pro- tocol attacks, providing an accuracy of 99.9 with negligible fall-positive rate.

In particular, network printers and multi- function printers (MFPs) have become attractive for cyber-attacks in many networks as they must expose many interfaces (both wired and wireless) and support many protocols in order to serve a broad base of in-house workers and ad hoc visitors. Pre- vious researches and publications have demonstrated the feasibility of compromising all kinds of printers [9-13], more on those researches will be provided in the related work section. Printing protocol attacks comprise a variety of malicious actions that an attacker can perform against the target printer, including among others: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, privilege escalation, leaking print jobs or system files; and even initiat- ing code execution on the printer itself [1].

PRET is an extremely popu- lar hacking tool dedicated to attacking network printers. Considering the aforemen- tioned risks, the prevalence of networked printers, and the variety of protocols they use, our aim in this research is to evaluate whether supervised machine learning (ML) is an effective method for intercepting the ever-increasing attacks on printing proto- cols.

Another study [15] employed ML algorithms to steal printed models (intellectual property) through side-channel attacks via noise and magnetic radiation of 3D print- ers.

To date, most of the research conducted on securing network printers and MFPs have focused on the printers' threats and vulnerabilities [16] and how to exploit them [12]. Research [17] has also proposed a method used to securely install and operate printers in the organization. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has focused on the detection of attacks on conventional (non-3D) printer protocols by training and testing supervised ML classifiers on a collection of malicious and benign traffic. PIDS is tailored to detect protocol attacks on networked printers and MFPs. For that purpose, we created a new dataset with thousands of automatic and manual printing protocol attacks on various printers, alongside with thousands of real-world recorded printers’ benign traffic.

      "system is the network traffic of the printers that are being monitored by the protection framework. The network traffic could be provided as real-time traffic or as recording network files in known formats like PCAP files. Real-time traffic could be captured in the network using implemented network monitoring devices (Network TAPs) [18,19] or as a simple configuration of printer port mirroring [20]. Our analysis of the printing protocols is based on analyz- ing the TCP sessions of the communication. Each traffic session (from SYN to FIN) will be analyzed by the framework. The results of this component will be an advanced vector of features that represent each session. To maintain reasonable performance, the system produces all the features from analyzing only the metadata of traffic. Our focus in this research is merely on analyzing metadata information network traffic as opposed to deep payload analysis.

      "Our focus in this research is merely on analyzing metadata information network traffic as opposed to deep payload analysis. The main reason for this decision is the performance constraint guiding us towards developing a light-weight IDS. This will enable simpler the deployment option of PIDS on the printer itself, as close as possi- ble to the printer’s motherboard and OS software. Another reason for choosing metadata analysis was the fact that every printer manufacturer may encode the inner payload of the printed job differently over the printing protocol. Therefore, PIDS with a payload inspection approach would require a different feature extraction module for each manufacturer. There are three main categories of features we capture: size, time, and TCP com- munication properties. Each category of features has many advanced statistics fea- tures that we were able to calculate: averages, medians, stdev (standard deviations), variances, minimum, maximum, and ratios between the two\n",

      "category of features has many advanced statistics fea- tures that we were able to calculate: averages, medians, stdev (standard deviations), variances, minimum, maximum, and ratios between the two sides of the connection. The two sides are named A and B, where A refers to the entity that initiated the TCP connection (sent the first SYN packet), and B refers to the entity that responded to the initiator A. The addition of this two-sided perspective increases the classifier’s ca- pacity to learn the benign and malicious behavior of the communicating sides. The behavioral model of each side of the network is different. Printers have their own unique behavior profile (like other communicating network entities which have their own behavior profiles) which we want to learn.

Generally speaking, one of the main challenges in research is how to achieve true, objective, and authentic datasets for experimentation. Our dataset contains thousands of malicious and benign labeled instances. Each instance is a fea- ture vector we specifically designed and extracted from the printers’ network traffic as described in 3.1. The instances were produced with our unique traffic data collec- tion and generation component and were labeled separately as malicious and benign traffic sessions according to the following description. 5 6 Benign Portion of the Dataset.

To collect valid benign printing protocol sessions, we recorded two months of traffic using network printers located in our labs’ offices (including eight different printers), based on a reasonable assumption that the actual printers used in our labs’ offices are not under attack during this period. This assump- tion is supported by the following facts: (1) In general, our offices’ network is well secured by the official university security team, and it adheres to the latest security standards. (2) We performed the recording between June and July 2016 almost a year before the open-source printer attacking tool, PRET, was published.

Table 1 provides detailed infor- mation on the printing protocol sessions we acquired during this two months record- ing period. The total number of benign sessions obtained in this phase of the dataset building process is 8,213 benign sessions. In addition, we purchased two new printers that were used solely for this research. We also recorded the benign printing protocol behavior of the new printers to make our benign dataset more robust. We printed 300 random documents on each of them, including different file formats: doc, docx, pdf, txt, ppt, pptx, and jpeg.

To collect such traffic, we recorded the network traffic while executing printing protocol attacks against dif- ferent printers. We developed a special extension for PRET using the guides on the website, “www.hacking-printers.net” [21]. The extension was crafted especially for performing the attacks in an automated and completely randomized manner. To facili- tate robust experiments, we needed many malicious sessions so that the classifier algorithm could learn the behavior of the attacks and their properties in the TCP ses- sion. Our PRET extension has two main capabilities - (1) Automation, and (2) ran- domization. (1) Automation - the extension has the ability to execute different attacks in a pre- defined loop.

We used this parameter to execute between 20 and 1,000 abnormal sessions on each printer. Each of those malicious sessions includes between one and 20 abnormal printing protocol commands. The extension has a bank of abnormal commands that are executed by the PRET frame- work, and these commands are listed in Table 2. An explanation of each of the com- mands can be found in the official GitHub page of the PRET tool [5]. Table 2. PRET commands divided by printing protocol and language type.

The tool gets a predefined bank of printers IPs, and PRET sent the commands to each of them in a continuous manner. (2) Randomization - in order to create ensure a diverse pool of malicious instances, the randomization of the automated abnormal sessions was crucial.

Figure 4 presents the randomization levels used by the extension. The importance of randomi- zation stems from the fact that in reality attacks can exhibit a high degree of variance. Sometimes an attacker will choose to send malicious commands to the printer sepa- rately and use a different communication session for each sent command. While at other times he/she will attempt to execute a few commands in a cascade during the same communication session initiated with the target printer. Furthermore, a specific attacker may choose to start with a specific command while others may prefer a dif- ferent execution order for their commands. In addition, the interval between sending the commands can be changed - some attackers will have automated tools and others will perform the attacks manually, and therefore we expect a large amount of variance in the\n",

Fig. 4. Randomization of sessions. Each of the commands in Table 2 is transformed to its corresponding low-level printing protocol command. Any other future printers attacking tool will still need to render and forward the same lower-level malicious printing protocols commands and thus our implementation is generic. This is also the reason why we configured PIDS as a network-based IDS network as opposed to a host-based IDS.

In order to serve as a protective solution for users around the world it need to have outstanding detection rates. The experiments also focused on finding the highest scor- ing features, using the three different feature selection methods that will be described further in the results section. From our perspective, it is crucial that the system be practical and lightweight; therefore, we aimed to decrease the number of features that are used from the total number of 75 features to just 10 features. We used five-fold cross-validation [22] to test and measure the detection perfor- mance. The dataset was divided into five subsets, and during each iteration, one of the five subsets was used as the test set and the other four subsets were merged to form the training set.

Cross- validation (CV) minimizes the overfitting problem, because the training samples are independent from the validation samples. The popularity of the CV method largely comes from the randomization and heuristics of the data splitting. This evaluation technique provides robust accuracy in the experiment testing process. The goal of the experiment was to validate the system’s detection algorithm on the research. In the experiment we compared the different algorithms and their capabili- ties of detecting malicious printing protocol commands.

One possible rea- son for this is that when malicious commands encapsulated in the printing protocols are sent, the receiving printer analyzes the commands and then sends back the results of those abnormal commands - a process which results in a longer time interval be- tween each packet that is sent by the printer. For example, for benign commands like those typically used for printing jobs, the printer just needs to send back a quick re- sponse that the printed job was indeed received, however a malicious command to read from the printer’s memory will cause the response time from the printer to be slower. Another interesting observation is that in 98% of the recorded sessions the printer was on side B and not side A. It means that most of the times the printers were not the side that initiated the connection. In those\n",

      "observation is that in 98% of the recorded sessions the printer was on side B and not side A. It means that most of the times the printers were not the side that initiated the connection. In those scenarios we analyzed the bytes_A_B_ratio feature, and found that about 70.45% of all of the benign printing commands were executed at a size ratio significantly lower than 0.38. This means that the network entity that communicates with the printer sends almost twice as much data to the printer than the amount of data sends by the printer. For example, when sending a print job of 500 kilobytes, typically the printer just sends back a few packets of ac- knowledgments totaling less than 190 kilobytes. On the other hand, in a possible at- tack scenario the attacker sends a very short command and might get an equal amount of data, or even more data, from the printer in return.

As a case in point, an abnormal reconnaissance command of querying the target printer for its type would include sending 528 bytes of data to the printer and receiving back 485 bytes of data (includ- ing the printer's model name). Another more drastic contrast occurs when sending a command to read a print job from the printer’s memory; this would entail sending a very short message (the malicious reading command) and then receiving the full print job which is obviously larger than the initial read command. In addition, when examining the packet_size_B_max feature we note that in 98.67% of all of the benign sessions, the maximal data transfer in a single packet from the printer is less than 50 bytes. This is because in a benign session the printer usually does not send much data back to the client entity, as most of the responded packets are merely acknowledgments and small predefined bit flags for updates\n",

      "in a benign session the printer usually does not send much data back to the client entity, as most of the responded packets are merely acknowledgments and small predefined bit flags for updates about the printer’s status (when the printer is busy or has finished printing the print job, when the printer is out of paper, etc.). In malicious sessions, however, only 9.04% of the sessions had a packet_size_B_max of less than 50 bytes, since the responses in such scenarios often contain leaked data to the attacker. The Naïve Bayes and K-Means algorithms had a 30% false positive rate and there- fore cannot be applied in a practical PIDS.

In this process of feature selection, we also found that there were six features which were selected to be among the top 10 features of two selection methods.

Two other features calculate the median of the time duration between the arrival of packets, one of them referring to the arrival times on side A, and the other refers to the same thing for side B. The reason for this could be that in the case of attack commands the printer needs more processing time in order to respond back to the attack side, and therefore the time interval between sent packets is larger. From the attacker network side, the time interval between sending multiple malicious commands could be higher than the time interval required for the automatic processing and sending of documents.

      "new threats against the printers used daily by individuals and organizations around the world and pointed to the need to improve the security mechanisms of printers. Follow our exper- iment we can observe that attacking commands from the open-source attacking tool, PRET, (the most popular attacking tool used against printers) could be detected by our framework. The practical implementation of our proposed framework could be achieved using an external analysis system or on the printers themselves, where each printer would be equipped with its own attacking detection component. The printer’s firmware could analyze the aforementioned protocols’ metadata traffic features to detect and abort abnormal printing protocols and issue anomaly alerts based on this detection. Another option is to use the suggested detection framework with passive learning of the actual monitored printers and then train and update the detection clas- sifier incrementally in real-time.

After a short learning period the detection frame- work would be ready to use and start issuing alerts regarding abnormal malicious printing protocol usage with high accuracy and a near zero false positive rate as indi- cated by our research. Moreover, PIDS is also designed to detect an already compromised printer and not only the preliminary printer infection stage of an attack. PIDS would alert on network anomalies, including the common attack scenarios of a printer that sends copies of its users’ printed jobs to an external target IP. It would also alert about differences in the size ratio between the data sent/received by the printer to/from an external target IP (as opposed of receiving more data in a benign scenario, the printer will send out more data when infected).

Another scenario could be an attacker that compromised a printer to serve as a launchpad for executing malicious code. The attacker can per- form malicious actions like network scanning of peer machines or operate stealthy C&C communications to other already compromised machines on the attacked net- work. Such malicious network communications would be different than thousands of real-life benign printing sessions we have researched and were used to train the PIDS’s classifier. An interesting comparison can be made between our research and [14]. While both of the studies deal with different types of threats, their research aims to detect physical damage in additive manufacturing (CNC milling) caused by cyber-attacks, and ours aims to detect attacks on network printers.

Both of the studies used ML algorithms for the detection process. However, this research achieved 99.9% accuracy using a simple C4.5 Decision Tree, while in their research they achieved 91.1% accuracy with the advanced Random Forest algorithm. A possible explanation for this difference is that their dataset is more complicated than ours. It will be interesting to evaluate the use of our framework in an additive manufacturing environment, using the 75 features ex- tracted from the associated network traffic and benchmark our performance again, so we can get a sense of whether our framework is also effective in the protection of 3D printing and CNC milling which have been shown vulnerable to cyber-attacks. 5 Conclusions This research demonstrates the proposed system’s ability to improve the security of printers.

Our results suggest that a supervised ML detection framework can provide nearly absolute detection rates for identifying malicious printing protocols traffic. The limitation of our research lies in the sole use of a supervised algorithm. We evaluated the detection framework on our own malicious printing protocol usage, however in the future there might be new types of attack scenarios and printer attack tools that will challenge the performance of our classifier (because the classifier was- n't trained on them).

In such a method there is no need to learn malicious behavior profiles in advance, because the framework will issue an anomaly alert when a deviation from the proper printing protocol (normal daily printer’s behavior) is detected. Another line of work will increase the scope of the framework so it can be used to protect other devices such as 3D printers, IP phones, smart IP projectors, etc. We will need to research the specific operating pro- tocols for each type of device, to record and learned their benign associated network traffic, perform multiple attacks against them, and record the malicious usage of their unique protocols.

The reader may con- sult [1] for all the diﬀerential geometric notion and results that are used in the paper. If N n is a submanifold of M m (indices denote dimension), then a normal- ization of N by a normal bundle νN is a splitting (1.1) T M |N = T N ⊕ νN (T denotes tangent bundles). A submanifold endowed with a normalization is called a normalized submanifold and a vector ﬁeld X on M is tangent or normal to N if X|N belongs to T N, νN , respectively. The best known case is that of a Riemannian normalization νN = T ⊥g N , where g is a Riemannian metric on M . In fact, given an arbitrary normalization, it is easy to construct metrics g such that the normalization is g-Riemannian.

In particular, it was shown that a Riemannian submanifold is totally geodesic iﬀ the metric is soldered to the submanifold and that a submanifold of a Poisson manifold is a (totally) Dirac submanifold iﬀ there exists a normalization such that the Poisson bivector ﬁeld is soldered to the submanifold with respect to\n",

In the present paper we give a general deﬁnition for the notion of soldering of an arbitrary tensor ﬁeld and we consider an obstruction to soldering, which, essentially, is a generalization of the second fundamental form of a Riemannian submanifold. We establish some formulas for the calculation of this obstruction and get corresponding applications. In particular, we prove that the almost complex structure J of an almost K¨ahler manifold is soldered to a submanifold iﬀ the latter is a J-invariant, totally geodesic submanifold. 2 Soldered tensor ﬁelds Let (N n, νN ) be a normalized submanifold of M m and let ι : N ⊆ M be the corresponding embedding.

From the deﬁnition of Ω we get (LX Ω)(Y1, Y2) = (LX g)(JY1, Y2) + g(LXJ(Y1), Y2), which, for ¯X ∈ νN for Y1, Y2 ∈ T N becomes (3.9) g(σJ (Y1, Y2), ¯X) = (LXΩ)(Y1, Y2) − g(σg(JY1, Y2), ¯X). Notice that Ω is algebraically compatible with (N, T ⊥g ), therefore, (LX Ω)(Y1, Y2) = g(σΩ(Y1, Y2), ¯X). Since it is easy to check that for the involved arguments one has (di(X)Ω)(Y1, Y2) = 0, by using LX = di(X) + i(X)d in (3.9), we get (3.10) g(σJ (Y1, Y2), ¯X) = dΩ( ¯X, Y1, Y2) − g(σg(JY1, Y2), ¯X).

The Au-Sn solder shows low-creep behavior, but induces the residual stress at the joint interface during bonding and system use due to its high stiffness and bonding temperature. Pure In solder exhibits excellent heat and electrical conductivity, but has poor creep resistance [3]. In this respect, eutectic In-Sn (In-48 wt.% Sn) solder alloy has been considered as a Pb-free solder material with good potential in the MOEMS package, due to its very low melting point, great ductility and long fatigue life [3-5].

These needs for the micro optical electro mechanical systems (MOEMS) have pushed the development of area-array packages, such as ball grid array (BGA), wafer level package (WLP) and flip-chip, due to their smaller package size, more input/output (I/O) pins and higher electrical performance.

However, the topmost Au layer remained even after bonding at 150 °C for 100 s, because of very low solubility and dissolution rate of Au in the molten In- 48Sn solder at 150 °C [10]. All Au atoms of the ENIG substrate reacted with the molten solder and spalled off to the solder during bonding, due to the layer thinness. Therefore, neither Au nor Au- based IMC layer could be observed at the solder/substrate interface after bonding.

The interfacial reaction between the solder and E-NG substrate formed a continuous facetted AuIn2 IMC layer during bonding. The solder/E-NG solder joint exhibited the highest shear force, while the displacement at break and work of break was low, due to the brittleness of AuIn2 IMC. During bonding, continuous Ni3(Sn,In)4 and Ni3P IMC layers were formed at the interface between the solder and ENIG substrate. The brittleness of the Ni3(Sn,In)4 IMC layer weakened the mechanical integrity of the solder joints. Cu6(Sn,In)5 IMC, having two different morphologies, was observed after bonding.

The solder joint defect detection system based on computer vision has the characteristics of real-time, continuous, and contact-less. This approach can take the place of manual detection and enhance the accuracy of results. At present, computer vision has been frequently employed in defect detection. Therefore, the use of computer vision for detecting solder joint defects has become a mainstream trend. In recent years, deep learning technology, that is one stream of computer vision has been developed rapidly. The research being developed for automated solder joint defect detection is still lacking. The methods for solder joint defect detection can be separated into three main groups, feature-based methods [WX18, XLLW21], statistical methods [YCL+18, CCW+21], and deep learning methods [CCW+18, DMES18, CT21a].

The deep learning method can learn effective information and rules from the solder joint image due to its CNN structure [LHL+22]. It can solve the problem that defective features are difficult to extract by artificially designed rules. The structures of deep learning neural network (DNN) can be seen in two folds: one is single-stage and the other is two-stage networks. Although the two-stage DNN is more accurate compared to the first stage, the shallow feature needs to be carefully utilized to avoid missing information during the feature extraction stage that will lead to lower detection rate. Its real-time performance is also poor, and it is not suitable for an industrial production environment. On the other hand, the one-stage method represented has good real-time performance and fast detection\n",

      "performance is also poor, and it is not suitable for an industrial production environment. On the other hand, the one-stage method represented has good real-time performance and fast detection speed, but the detection effect is not good for small defect area and low-resolution images [HJW23a]. In the feature extraction module of defect detection, the target feature information is lost too much, and the detection rate of small defect is not ideal, leading to serious issues of missed detection [ZS21]. The deep learning method uses deep neural network to extract features, but as the network layers of the deep neural network deepen, some shallow information is easily lost, leading to missed detection of small-sized object. To address this issue, the multi-scale feature fusion method is adopted to fuse deep and shallow features in the feature extraction process, enhancing information transmission between different network layers. Therefore, optimizing feature fusion methods can promote the\n",

      "to fuse deep and shallow features in the feature extraction process, enhancing information transmission between different network layers. Therefore, optimizing feature fusion methods can promote the improvement of detection accuracy for small-sized object. Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [LDG+17] obtains feature images of different scales through multiple up-sampling of the input image. It integrates the abstract semantic information extracted from the high-level with the specific details, like the low-level contour texture in the feature extraction process from top to bottom to fulfill the goal of feature extraction enhancement. However, although FPN has systematically extracted the low-level and high-level features, its feature fusion capability still cannot meet the requirements, making it difficult to retain shallow features information. To address the missing information between high-level and low-level features, Liu et al. [LQQ+18] designed Path Aggregation Network (PANet) to\n",

This process is done to shorten the transmission path of information fusion, to feed the fusion network location data with fine-grained features to increase the feature pyramid architecture’s detection capacity.

BiFPN assigns weights to each layer of adaptive learning, and through the allocation of weights, the network perceives the importance of different levels. Multi scale feature fusion is widely used in small object detection. It significantly improves the detection performance of small objects by combining high-level semantic information with low-level detailed information. However, the construction of the FPN is mainly divided into cross-layer connection and parallel branch.

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [LDG+17] is a feature fusion method commonly used for object detection, which is a network model for extracting pyramid feature representations. It is usually used in the feature fusion stage of object detection. After performing a bottom-up feature extraction operation on the backbone network, the FPN is connected to the corresponding layer’s feature maps from top to bottom and horizontally, sequentially combining the two adjacent layers in the backbone network’s feature hierarchy to construct a feature pyramid. Although FPN is simple and effective, some aspects still have shortcomings.

Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BIFPN) [13] introduces jump connections, which uses the jump connections to transfer information between input and output layers of features. Because the operation is in the same layer, this method can combine more features with fewer parameters. In order to accomplish more feature fusion, BIFPN calculates the same layer parameters more than once, treating each two-way path as one feature network layer.

It has a reasonable detection rate for missing components, missing wire, and reverse polarity defects but a low detection rate for Surface defects. The reason is that the size of the surfaces defect is relatively small and the distribution position is uncertain, so it is difficult to detect. Yang et al.

The inspiration for the attention mechanism comes from the vision system in humans, which can quickly browse images, locate the target area of interest, and enhance attention to the target area, thereby obtaining important information in that area and suppressing interference from other unrelated areas. Hu et al. proposed an attention module called Squeeze and Stimulation (SE) [HSS18].

The method designed in this article enhances the feature fusion capability of the network through an improved attention mechanism. The experimental results show that our method achieves a mAP of 91.5% on the solder joint defect dataset, which 4.3% more expensive than the comparison model. Compared with the popular self attention improvement models STC-YOLO and TPH-YOLOv5, the mAP is 2.8% and 0.6% higher, and the FPS index is 159.8, which is 22.5 and 31.6 higher than STC-YOLO and TPH-YOLOv5, respectively. This FPS indicate shows that our model performs well in real-time and is beneficial for the application of industrial scenarios. The next step will be to continue improving the network to make it more lightweight in model parameters, while further improving the detection accuracy of solder joint defects.

      "technology have made it possible for end users to casually fabricate 3D plastic objects. Many ’makers’ would like to add interactivity to their printed objects using sensors, lights, motors, and so on. How- ever, incorporating the necessary electric circuits into these objects has not become inherently easier with 3D printing. Electric circuits are typically designed in 2D, and mounted on planar geometries, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) Inserting a ﬂat circuit inside a 3D object requires extensive geometry editing to create cavities, wire routing paths, and ﬁxtures. This is generally beyond the reach of the novice or casual maker. the mechanical and electrical functions of simple objects. Our approach, which we call SurfCuit, allows the user to design and construct functional and durable electric circuits on the surface of 3D prints (see Fig. 1).

      "electric circuits on the surface of 3D prints (see Fig. 1). As a prototyping method, surface mounting has various ad- vantages over embedded circuitry. First, construction is much easier since the parts are accessible from outside – the user does not need to insert the electric parts during printing, or try to ﬁt components into tiny cavities. Second, it is easy to debug and repair surface-mounted circuits, while in many embedded-circuit applications this is difﬁcult or impossible. Finally, the circuit design task is greatly simpliﬁed – com- pared to three-dimensional arrangements of cavities, ﬁxtures, and wire channels, surface layouts are intuitive and efﬁcient to create. An alternative to is to use 3D circuitry, where 3D traces are embedded into the object volume or surface. However exist- ing CAD interfaces and fabrication techniques have not been designed with 3D circuits in mind.

      "exist- ing CAD interfaces and fabrication techniques have not been designed with 3D circuits in mind. In this paper, we demon- strate both a design tool and fabrication technique to integrate Our key challenges are (i) how to fabricate complex circuits on the surface of 3D prints and (ii) how to help the user per- form the circuit layout task directly on the 3D surface in a computational design tool. Conductive inks do not readily adhere to 3D print plastics and their resistance is too high for many types of components. Instead, SurfCuit uses copper tape and tubes that are soldered together to achieve mechani- cally durable and highly conductive circuits. We leverage the fact that near soldering temperature, 3D-printed PLA plastic melts to a sticky viscous ﬂuid that bonds well to copper ma- terial.

These channels both help the user to re-create their virtual circuit traces in the physical world, and also help to 1 ﬁrmly afﬁx the copper tape and through-hole parts onto the 3D print. The traces which connect components in an eletrical circuit must be physically isolated, i.e. they cannot intersect with ea- chother. Because they exist in a (possibly curved) 2D space, with even a moderate number of traces it becomes very dif- ﬁcult to create the circuit without carefully planning out the traces ahead of time. Board layout and planning software like EAGLE is an essential tool for planar circuit desgin. However no existing circuit planning tool is applicable to arbitrary 3D surfaces. In addition, strips of copper tape cannot follow arbi- trary paths on 3D surfaces, as many paths introduce too much torsion into the tape, which will result in kinks or\n",

      "to arbitrary 3D surfaces. In addition, strips of copper tape cannot follow arbi- trary paths on 3D surfaces, as many paths introduce too much torsion into the tape, which will result in kinks or tears. The strips should be laid out along geodesics, and without com- putational guidance it is very difﬁcult to ensure that the 3D traces have this property. SurfCuit offers an interactive de- sign tool that allows the user to easily adapt an existing planar circuit schematic to a 3D surface. To demonstrate the capabilities of SurfCuit, we have designed and fabricated a variety of 3D objects with 3D circuitry. Some of these examples involve circuit complexity and levels of voltage/current that are well beyond what has been demon- strated in the literatuer. In addition, we also perform some destructive testing to demonstrate the robustness of our fabri- cation process. We show various examples of how our system facilitates the user’s creation of functional 3D objects with electric circuits.\n",

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Molded Intergrated Devices Various advanced manufacturing technologies support the fabrication of circuitry that conforms to curved surfaces. For example, the Optomec Aerosol Jet system can create metal traces on simple 3D forms using laser metal deposi- tion techniques. Another technology, Molded Interconnect Devices (MID), makes it possible to install circuitry on plas- tic surfaces. MID enables functional integration of electric circuit into small spaces, thus is often used for compact im- plementation of electronic products such as cell phones, cars, and advanced micro robots (see Figure 2). However, man- ufacturing such objects involves multi-axis laser engraving machines and etching/plating baths only found in advanced industrial facilities. Our SurfCuit system\n",

Our SurfCuit system is inspired by these techniques, but our goal is to introduce MID-style fabrication in a more accessible context. In addition, currently there are no CAD tools for MID design. Our SurfCuit design tool is di- rectly applicable to these advanced manufacturing methods. Figure 2. Example of molded interconnected devices.

[19] studied frequency-dependent impedance properties to detect conﬁg- urations of conductive 3D objects. Printput [7] and Capri- cate [23] use conductive ﬁlaments to convert the surface of 3D prints into capacitive touch sensors. However, such con- ductive ﬁlament traces have very high resistance, making it difﬁcult to supply enough current to drive larger components (See Section Resistance Comparison). Fabricating 3D circuit traces inside ”tubes” passing through the interior of 3D prints was explored by Savage et. al. [21]. This method is effective at hiding the circuitry, but also il- lustrates the challenge of repairing such devices. The ca- pabilities of the automatic routing algorithms also limit the complexity of the circuits that can be designed with this ap- proach.

The robustness of electrical connections is very important for permanent circuit construction — disconnection of a single trace can disable an entire circuit. However, constructing ro- bust, highly conductive traces on a curved 3D-printed sur- faces has been difﬁcult. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that PLA and ABS plastics that they melt into sticky, glue-like viscous ﬂuids at around 200◦C. Since the melting point of solder is also around that temperature, soldering on traces and pins melts the surrounding 3D plastic and strength- ens the mechanical bonds between them. The result is that after cooling, the highly conductive copper traces are ﬁrmly afﬁxed to the surface of the 3D print. Note that our approach is inspired by recent works that exploit melting behaviors for fabrication [14,\n",

      "cooling, the highly conductive copper traces are ﬁrmly afﬁxed to the surface of the 3D print. Note that our approach is inspired by recent works that exploit melting behaviors for fabrication [14, 18]. However here we use melting for bond- ing, not for forming. This melting technique creates strong connections, but ac- tually using it on 3D surfaces requires some pre-planning. Computational design tools are necessary to plan the spatial layout for complex circuits. To guide the user in fabricating their design, we computationally generate channels and holes in the 3D surface before printing, which also helps to increase circuit robustness. Hence, the workﬂow of SurfCuit fabrica- tion is as follows (see Fig. 3): 1. In the SurfCuit design tool, the user ﬁrst draws a 2D cir- cuit schematic diagram, then lays out the electric parts and traces on a 3D surface. 2.

SurfCuit generates a 3D mesh with channels and holes that guide the user to install copper tape and tubes on a 3D print. Construction Detail Our circuit fabrication process is intended to be used with though-hole parts. Though-hole parts are desirable because they are widely available and are easy to manually solder. More importantly, through-hole parts achieve mechanically stronger bonds compared to surface mounted parts. Thus, they can be left exposed on the surface. The interval between pins is typically 1/10 inch = 2.54 mm for though-hole parts. Our technique maintains sufﬁcient isolation between neigh- boring traces by keeping the trace width and pin diameter smaller than this interval (see Fig. 4). top viewcross sectonal view 1.8mm2.54mm 1.5mm 3.5mm 0.75mm Figure 4.

With SurfCuit, a novice maker can easily create complex functional 3D objects using widely-available single-material FDM printers. The soldering process requires exactly the same skills as fabricating a 2D circuit, which we already know that nearly anyone can learn to do. Applying solder to the copper tape is not difﬁcult, as the solder naturally ﬂows into the trace channels due to surface tension (see accompa- nying video). This soldering step also thickens the traces, further increasing mechanical robustness and electrical con- ductivity. The holes help to temporarily hold components in place while they are soldered The channels partially enclose the traces and prevent them from peeling off.

Since copper tape is placed in a V-shaped channel, it is easy to cover the channel with solder – surface tension makes the solder naturally ﬂow into the channel. The use of solid copper, rather than conductive inks or similar alternatives, is desirable for three reasons. First, copper has 3 comparatively high conductivity / low resistance (less than 0.5 Ω/m in our traces). Thus, we are not limited by parasitic resistance when using the large electric currents typically nec- essary for driving small motors or incandescent lights. Sec- ondly, its high heat conductivity makes it possible to bond copper to 3D-printed plastics via the application of heat. Fi- nally, the copper is solderable.

Compared to silver-based conductive inks (the most conduc- tive), copper is also inexpensive and widely available. To make 1/16 inch traces, we split widely available 1/8 inch cop- per tape (about 10$ for 50 m) in half using a rotary cutter. For copper pins, we used 1/16 inch copper tubes manufactured via K&S Engineering .Inc (three dollars for 1 m). Resistance Comparison During the development of our fabrication process, we ex- perimented with various conductive inks and copper paints. However we found that most are difﬁcult to apply to plas- tic surfaces. Liquid-based materials were also unreliable as a small crack results in electrical disconnection. This is especially problematic on the rough surfaces of 3D FDM prints, where the ink will tend to pool into the small cavi- ties and channels produced by the printing process, creating highly variable thickness in the conductive layer.\n",

Further- more, as reported in the previous studies, the electric resis- tance in the conductive liquids are very high (e.g, 11.48 Ω for a 28cm x 0.5cm trace using silver conductive ink [13] and 2 Ω/inch for a 3mm diameter tunnel ﬁlled with copper paint [21]). We also tried drawing traces with conductive PLA ﬁlament using a hand-held plastic extruder, however again the resis- tance is signiﬁcantly higher than typical PCB traces, and thus cannot support many common circuits. For example, Black Magic 3D’s Conductive Graphene Filament, which has one of the highest conductivity among the ﬁlaments on the mar- ket, still has 0.6 Ω/cm3 volume resistivity.

Such resistance causes over a 1V voltage drop with only 2mA current, which is barely enough to light an LED. Generally, conductive ﬁlaments are sufﬁcient for capacitive touch sensors or blinking LEDs, how- ever they fall short when attempting to drive common micro- controllers, actuators, and transducers.

To demonstrate the mechanical robustness of our approach, we made a qualitative comparison with a na¨ıve method using destructive testing (see Figure 5). 4 In the na¨ıve construction method, traces are just copper tapes placed on the 3D prints without the channels and solder. The tape generally has a sticky backing which is sufﬁcient to hold it in place. The test circuits light a LED using a trace pat- tern that consists of more than twenty copper tapes (see Fig- ure).

The circuit with na¨ıve construction immediately stopped functioning when the soft nylon brush was applied. This is because the connection between overlapping copper tape seg- ments is particularly weak and breaks under small mechanical forces. After few additional seconds of brushing, the cop- per tape segments in the na¨ıve construction start to peel off the plastic. After one minute, the copper traces in the na¨ıve construction were severely damaged, to the point where the circuit would need to be entirely rebuilt. On the other hand, there was no visual damage to the SurfCuit traces even after the brushing with the hard brush.

Each trace that is added constrains the design space of future traces, because no traces can intersect. For the 2D ﬂat circuits, we can plan on a paper or in vector-graphics CAD tools.

First, a point on a triangle is updated in the direction of the triangle’s tangent vector (cid:126)t until it hits the boundary (edge) of the triangle. Then, at the boundary we transform (cid:126)t into the plane of the next triangle using a minimal rotation around the edge of the triangle, i.e. the rotation that takes the current triangle normal to the neighboring triangle normal. We stop this update when the pi and qi move 1 mm along the surface, and call them pi+1 and qi+1. This simple algorithm can fail when the normal of the sur- face (i.e., (cid:126)np or (cid:126)nq) becomes parallel to (cid:126)pi − (cid:126)qi (see Fig.7- (1) (2) 6VLDRNE555chirping birdsmartphone standpolice car 9V LM386 6V NE555NE555 Figure 8.

This example also demonstrates the inclusion of an IC with many pins using SurfCuits. Such complex circuits typically need cables over the traces when constructed on a single-sided 2D board. However, in the Surfcuit, we can take advantage of the three dimensional structure of the object to avoid such cables. For example, if we cannot connect two parts on the front side without intersection, the trace can go around the back side. Because the circuit construction is three-dimensional, there are more degrees of freedom in the trace layout.

This smartphone stand exempliﬁes the integration of geomet- ric and electrical functionality. While the original geometry provides the function to hold a smartphone, the circuit ampli- ﬁes the audio signal. 3D printing makes it easy to fabricate the precise shape needed. Achieving the same geometrical functionality is very difﬁcult with ﬂat circuits. Police Car The police car example (Fig. 8) integrates a circuit that blinks a LED beacon while a magnetic speaker generates siren sounds, which is modulated by two 555 timer ICs.

Notable examples include Swiss watches showing the gear work or movement, the iMac G3’s translucent body, and the intentionally-exposed functional and structural elements of the Pompidou museum in Paris. Although we cannot claim our own results as works of art, SurfCuit enables this aesthetic by making it easy for creative users to integrate circuitry elements into the external design of complex 3D shapes. For example, our featureless car above was turned into a police car with more interesting steampunk styling. To further illustrate this concept, we created a circuit that il- luminates EL (electro-luminescent) wires whose placement is designed based on an existing circuit-like facial tattoo (see Fig. 11).

These objects can be obtained from the restriction of a scalar ﬁeld to move in one direction only, as done by Siegel[3], or by a ﬁrst-order Lagrangian theory, as proposed by Floreanini and Jackiw[4].

      "and Jackiw[4]. The equivalence of these two independent descriptions for chiral scalars has been established both in the context of Senjanovic[5] formalism of constrained path-integral in [6], and later, in the operatorial canonical approach in [7], by gauge-ﬁxing an existing symmetry in Siegel’s model. This proce- dure will leave behind only one degree of freedom in phase-space, corresponding to the chiral excitations, just as in the Floreanini-Jackiw model. Scalar ﬁelds in 2D can be viewed as bosonized versions of Dirac fermions and chiral bosons can be seen to correspond to two dimensional versions of Weyl fermions. In a more formal level, it has been shown by Sonneschein[8] and by Tseytlin and West[9] that, in some sense, the sum of the ﬂat space-time actions of two chiral scalars of opposite chirality, does correspond to the action of a single 2D scalar ﬁeld. This seems correct since the number of degrees of freedom adds up correctly, and a 2D, conformally invariant ﬁeld theory,\n",

      "opposite chirality, does correspond to the action of a single 2D scalar ﬁeld. This seems correct since the number of degrees of freedom adds up correctly, and a 2D, conformally invariant ﬁeld theory, is known to possess two independent current algebras associated with each of the chiral components. In a more detailed study, Stone[10] has shown that one needs more than the direct sum of two fermionic representations of the Kac-Moody group to describe a Dirac fermion. Stated diﬀerently, the action of a bosonized Dirac fermion is not simply the sum of the actions of two bosonized Weyl fermions, or chiral bosons. Physically, this is connected with the necessity to abandon the separated right and left symmetries, and accept that vector gauge symmetry should be preserved at all times. This restriction will force the two independent chiral scalars to belong to the same multiplet, eﬀectively soldering them together.

      "will force the two independent chiral scalars to belong to the same multiplet, eﬀectively soldering them together. The basic idea in [10] to sew the two de-quantized left and right Dirac seas of each Weyl component, was to introduce a gauge ﬁeld to remove the obstruction to vector gauge invariance. This gauge ﬁeld, being just an auxiliary ﬁeld, without any dynamics, can be eliminated in favor of the physically relevant quantities. In this work we follow the basic physical principle of [10] to solder together two Siegel chiral bosons of opposite chiralities to establish the formal equivalence with a single scalar ﬁeld in a gravitational background. In section 2 we present the gauge procedure necessary for the soldering of the chiral scalars, obtaining a Lagrangian that is invariant under vector gauge transformations.

In section 3 we study the symmetry group of the quoted Lagrangian, showing that it can be written in a way where the 2 full diﬀeomorphism invariance becomes manifest. In section 4 some considerations regarding truncations, generators of gauge transformations and a hidden duality sym- metry are discussed. Further geometrical considerations are done in section 5. The last section is reserved for some ﬁnal comments and perspectives. 2 The gauging procedure To begin with, lets us review a few known facts about Siegel’s theory4. First, one can see this model as the result of gauging the semi-local aﬃne symmetry[11] δϕ = ǫ−∂ ϕ ; ∂ ǫ− = 0 − − possessed by the action of a free scalar ﬁeld. This can be done with the introduction of a gauge ﬁeld λ++, as long as it transforms as δλ++ = − ∂+ǫ− + ǫ−∂ − λ++ − λ++∂ − ǫ− . The result of this procedure is a Siegel action for a left-moving chiral boson L (+) 0 = ∂+ϕ∂ − ϕ + λ++∂ − ϕ∂ − ϕ . One can also interpret this theory\n",
      "-----------------------------------\n",
      "as δλ++ = − ∂+ǫ− + ǫ−∂ − λ++ − λ++∂ − ǫ− . The result of this procedure is a Siegel action for a left-moving chiral boson L (+) 0 = ∂+ϕ∂ − ϕ + λ++∂ − ϕ∂ − ϕ . One can also interpret this theory as describing the action for the coupling of scalar ﬁeld to a chiral W2-gravity[11]. The gauge ﬁeld is just a Lagrange multiplier imposing the constraint T −− = ∂ − ϕ ∂ − ϕ ≈ 0 , known to satisfy the conformal algebra. Similarly, one can gauge the semi-local aﬃne symmetry δϕ = ǫ+∂+ϕ ; ∂+ǫ+ = 0 to obtain the right-moving Siegel chiral boson, by introducing the gauge ﬁeld λ such that ǫ+ + ǫ+∂+λ ∂+ǫ+ . δλ ∂ λ = − −− − − In fact, if we write the right and left chiral boson actions as 4We are using standard light-front variables: x± = 1 √2 −− −− x0 x1 ± (cid:0) (cid:1) 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) −− (6) L ( ) 0 = ± 1 2 J ± (ϕ)∂ ∓ ϕ with J (ϕ) = 2 (∂ ϕ + λ ∂ ϕ) ± it is easy to verify that these models are indeed invariant under Siegel’s transforma- tions (1,2) and (5,6), using that ± ±± ∓ δJ ± = ǫ ± ∂ ∓ J\n",

We should mention that the Noether current J+ deﬁned above is in fact the non vanishing component of the left chiral current J+ = J −(L), while J − is the non vanishing component of the right chiral current J (R), with the left and right currents being deﬁned in terms of the axial and vector currents as = J + − J (L) µ = J (A) µ = J (A) J (R) µ + J (V ) µ J (V ) µ µ − , .

Let us next consider the question of the vector gauge symmetry. We can use an iterative Noether procedure to gauge the global U(1) symmetry δϕ = α , δλ++ = 0 possessed by Siegel’s model (3). Under the action of the group of transformations (11), written now with a local parameter, the action (3) changes as δ L (+) 0 = ∂ − αJ+ with the Noether current J+ = J+(ϕ) being given as in (8). To cancel this piece, we introduce a gauge ﬁeld A coupled to the Noether current, redeﬁning the original − Siegel’s Lagrangian density as 4 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) L (+) 0 → L (+) 1 = L (+) 0 + A − J+ , (13) where the variation of the gauge ﬁeld is deﬁned as δA − = − ∂ − α .

(16) This left over piece cannot be canceled by a Noether counter-term, so that a gauge invariant action for ϕ and A does not exist, at least with the introduction of only one gauge ﬁeld. We observe, however, that this action has the virtue of having a variation dependent only on A and not on ϕ. Expression (16) is a reﬂection of the standard anomaly that is intimately connected with the chiral properties of ϕ. − − Now, if the same gauging procedure is followed for an opposite chirality Siegel boson, say L ( 0 = ∂+ρ∂ − − ) ρ + λ −− ∂+ρ∂+ρ (17) subject to δρ = α , = 0 , δλ −− δA+ = − ∂+α , (18) then one ﬁnds that the sum of the right and left gauged actions made gauge invariant if a contact term of the form L (+) 2 + L ( − 2 ) can be LC = 2A+A − (19) is introduced.

The way we have parametrized the metric has made explicit that the naive sum of two Siegel metrics is not the metric of a full diﬀeomorphism invariant theory. In this sense we could reveal the relashionship between Siegel symmetry and diﬀeomorphism. We have also discovered a surprising duality in the model, which is related to the symmetry under the exchange between the left and right movers.

      "integration (VLSI) is moving from 2D IC to 3D IC [1-3]. The latter has various chips stacking vertically, which requires the development of new technologies such as TSV (through-Si-Via) and micro-bumps. More importantly, the 3D IC packaging technology will need to use a hierarchy of solder joints. In other words, low (around 100 oC), middle (200 oC), and high (300 oC) wetting temperature solders will work together, so that different components can be stacked and integrated. At the moment, we have the high-Pb Pb95Sn5 solder for the high melting point and the eutectic SnAg solder for the middle melting point [4-5]. But for the low melting point, we only have eutectic SnBi, which has a melting point of 138oC with a soldering temperature about 150 oC [6-7]. It would be better if we could lower the soldering temperature furthermore to 100 oC.

Pieces about 5- 10 mg were cut from the bulk solder alloy. These pieces were analyzed by differential thermal analysis (DTA) to measure the melting point of SnBiInZn solder. To study the wetting behavior, we polished copper foils with 2.5 μm diamond abrasion paste and cleaned with deionized water.

We also succeeded to wet the HEA solder on a Cu plate at 100 oC for 10 min and 20 min. After reflow, we cooled the samples in air to room temperature and cleaned the samples with pure alcohol. The wetting samples were mounted in epoxy resin. The cross-sections were polished with SiC papers successively and then with 0.04 μm SiO2 powder suspension. We observed the cross-sections of the polished samples by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The elemental composition of IMC was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX).

Fig. 1(b) and 1(c) are the XRD results of the original HEA solder and pure Sn, respectively. By comparison, we can see the Sn-rich phase in the alloy has broader peaks than pure Sn, also there is a tiny shift in the peak position, implying the Sn-rich phase is a solid solution. It needs to be noted that, we do have InBi and Bi phase in the alloy and the entropy of this alloy may not be as high as other HEAs. But the Sn-rich phase in the alloy does have a solid solution structure and for that phase, it has a high entropy. The HEA solder structure seems to be very stable and there is no big difference before and after reflow. More characterization results about the Sn-rich solid solution phase after reflow reaction will be presented. DTA was performed to find the solder melting point around 80 oC, as shown in Fig 4 2(a).

After being reflowed at 160 oC for 5 min and 20 min, another small peak around 56 oC occurred in the DTA curve, shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), indicating that some phase transformation had taken place inside the HEA material during the reflow. Fig. 3(a) to (d) show the wetting angle after soldering for 10 min at 100 oC to 160 oC. The wetting angle is about 35 to 40 degrees after soldering at 120 oC to 160 oC for different length of time, but more than 50 degrees at 100 oC. When we further reduced the reflow time to 1 min, we noticed that at the reflow temperature of 140 oC and 160 oC, we can have successful soldering. However, we were unable to achieve repetitively good solder joint at the reflow temperature of 100 oC and 120 oC with just 1 min reflow time.

Often, we obtained a very thin layer of IMC (less than 200 nm) in the solder joints after reflow. We tend to believe that the flux is not quite efficient at such a low working temperature (100 oC and 120 oC). Our future work would include the finding of a flux with a low working temperature at 100 oC for 1 min reflow.

The microstructure of the HEA cap is very complicated and has at least three detectable phases, including the phases of almost pure Bi phase, InBi phase, and Sn- rich phase, as marked in both Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(d). These three phases have also been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the ion beam image in Fig. 4(c), more information could be revealed, where three to four different phases with different extent of gray could be seen. Some twin structure is observed in one of those phases, which is marked by the white arrow. In the IMC part, there seems to be two layers of IMCs, marked by the two black\n",

In the IMC part, there seems to be two layers of IMCs, marked by the two black arrows. To have a better understanding of the HEA solder matrix and the formed IMC after reaction, TEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after the solder being reflowed for 5 min at 160 oC. Fig. 5(a) is a bright-field (BF) STEM image, and we can observe solder layer, IMC layer and Cu layer in the image. Fig. 5(b) is a higher magnification BF TEM image, and two layers of IMC can be distinguished. Fig. 5(c) is a HAADF STEM image and we can observe some Kirkendall voids located between IMC and the Cu substrate. In the IMC layer, there are some tiny darker spots. From the EDX results, shown in Fig. 5(d), where we did EDX line scan along the arrow in Fig. 5(a), we tend to regard those two layers as Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 with a few percent of Zn and In.

Though the solder may not be defined exactly as HEA, since it has less than five main elements in it, it should be appropriate to define the solder as medium entropy alloy. The application of HEA as solder in this work is a novel try and should have plenty of following work in the future. 3.2 Growth kinetics of IMCs To study IMC growth kinetics, the thickness of the IMC formed at 120 oC, 140 oC and 160 oC after different reflow time was measured. The measured thicknesses are 7 plotted in Fig. 7(a). The mean thicknesses, L, can be described very well by Eq. (1), and the growth rate D can be calculated using the following equation [4].

Fitting the measured thickness into Eq. (1) by taking the logarithm on both sides, we obtain the calculated n to be 0.30, 0.32, and 0.36 respectively for 120, 140, and 160 oC. The data fits well with the published Cu6Sn5 ripening growth kinetics data with n = 1/3 [9-10]. The activation energy is then calculated from the slopes of the fitted lines to be 18.0 kJ/mol, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Some published data on the activation energy for solid-liquid interfacial reactions of Cu-Sn has been reported to be 19.72 kJ/mol [11] and 29 kJ/mol [12].

By comparison, we can figure that the activation energy we measured in HEA solder/Cu reaction is in the same range. Significantly, while the activation energy of solid-liquid interfacial reaction of the HEA solder on Cu is in the same range as other conventional solders, the rate of IMC formation is much slower. It’s worth noting that after HEA solder reflowing for 10 and 20 min at 100 oC, the average IMC thickness is measured to be 1.32 and 1.49 μm, 8 respectively. This is surprising and it could be a unique nature of the HEA alloy because the entropy factor is in the pre-factor “A” as shown in Eq. (2). In the temperature range of 100 to 160 °C, the solid-solid interfacial reaction occurs in the conventional solders.

On the other hand, if we conduct solid-liquid interfacial reaction for 10 to 20 min, say in eutectic SnAg solder on Cu, the IMC will be over 10 μm [13-15], which is much thicker than that observed here. In theory, the pre-factor 𝐴 ∝ exp ( ∆𝑆 𝑅 ) and S represents the activation entropy. Neglecting the change in vibrational entropy during the IMC formation, we may approximately take ∆𝑆 ≈ 𝑆tran − 𝑆HEA, where Stran and SHEA stand for the configurational entropy of the transition state and the original HEA respectively during IMC formation. Since 𝑆HEA of HEAs is very high at a high homologous temperature, which could reach the prediction of the ideal mixing rule [13-14], we herein propose that the low pre-factor A may be attributed to the entropy reduction during the IMC formation in the HEA.

In case that 𝑆tran ≪ 𝑆HEA, 𝐴 ∝ exp (− 𝑆HEA 𝑅 ) and hence, high configurational entropy could lead to rather low reaction kinetics, as seen in our experiments. It should be noted that, even after 20 min reflow at 100 oC, the IMC thickness is still very thin with an average thickness of 1.49 um. If we could find a high efficiency flux and obtain a successful wetting solder joint at 100 oC, we expect a very thin layer of IMC in the joint after reflow for 1 min. The thin thickness of IMC layer could relieve many yield and reliability issues in the future small size solder joints. For example, we might not need the Ni layer as the diffusion barrier on the Cu under bump metallization (UBM) to prevent the high Cu consumption rate as well as Kirkendall void formation. 9 The latter has been associated to the growth of a thick layer of Cu3Sn between Cu6Sn5 and Cu [15-17].

This is because the void nucleation requires the super-saturation of vacancies in Cu3Sn and in its interface with Cu. As shown in Fig. 5, there are only some tiny Kirkendall voids in our sample even after reflow for 5 min at 160 oC. Kirkendall voids related reliability issues would be mitigated by our solder. 3.3 Shear test results The mechanical properties of this low melting point solder joint were investigated by shear test and the test results are listed in Table 1. The average shear strength is measured to be about 19 MPa to 28 MPa. According to the published data, solders with different composition, including Sn-0.4Cu, Sn-3Ag-0.4Cu, Sn-58Bi, and SnZnBi, have the shear strength of 19.5 MPa, 32.5 MPa, 64 MPa, and 18.5-28.0 MPa, respectively [18-20].

Comparing with the published data, we conclude that the HEA solder joint has a relatively good mechanical strength. Interestingly, even though at 100 oC and 120 oC, we can only have a very thin layer of IMC, the solder joint strength is still good.

INTRODUCTION Nowadays, the production of a large number of good quality (RE)BaCuO (RE = rare earth) single-domain bulk samples by the top-seeded melt textured growth (TSMTG) process is well established [1].

      "[1]. Nevertheless, applications based on superconducting technology require complex-shaped superconducting single-domains. For example, a superconducting ring is required for making flywheels [2-4]. More complex shapes are required for applications involving superconducting rotating machines [5] or magnetic field shields [6]. In order to produce complex-shaped samples, the growth of large single grains which would be drilled and machined is not the best solution [7]. The main reason is that the sample inhomogeneity increases with increasing size. These inhomogeneities mainly affect the 1 transport current; consequently large samples usually display a smaller critical current density, Jc, than smaller ones. Moreover, machining ceramics, and especially superconducting (RE)BaCuO single-domains, is very difficult because of the poor mechanical properties of such materials; they are very brittle [8].

      "is very difficult because of the poor mechanical properties of such materials; they are very brittle [8]. An alternative way to produce complex shape superconducting materials is to use the Infiltration and Growth (IG) process instead of TSMTG process. The IG process is based on the infiltration of a barium and copper rich liquid phase into a RE-211 preform, which could have a complex shape, even a foam structure, at a temperature near the peritectic temperature of the RE-123 phase [7,9-17]. This technique allows obtaining high density materials with small size RE-211-particles well dispersed in the bulk [9]. Moreover a near-net shape material can be obtained. Indeed, the process leads to a limited shrinkage which reduces cracks and distortions in the superconducting matrix In order to manufacture large single-domains, it is also possible and efficient to weld small high-quality single-domains together.

      "large single-domains, it is also possible and efficient to weld small high-quality single-domains together. In such a case, the junction has to display the highest possible critical current density. Various techniques for joining (RE)BaCuO single- domains have been developed: (i) a natural joining using a multi-seeding technique [18-23] ; (ii) diffusion bonding of polished surfaces under uniaxial pressure in absence of soldering agents; and (iii) artificial joining by using low peritectic temperature rare earth cuprate ceramics, like YbBa2Cu3O7, ErBa2Cu3O7 or TmBa2Cu3O7, as soldering agents [24-29]. Silver has been also used to reduce locally the peritectic temperature of the RE-123 phase [20,30,31]. Unfortunately, using low melting point RE-123 compounds leads to microstructural inhomogeneities which affect locally the critical current density.

However the processing time is long because YBCO/Ag single-domains have to be prepared prior to manufacture the junction. Recently Iliescu et al. [32] have proposed an alternative method for single-domain welding along (100) or (010) planes. The authors suggest the use of a silver foil as a welding agent. This set-up gives good results and allows scaling up the production of welded samples. In this paper, we have studied the efficiency of silver paint as a soldering agent. The main advantage of silver paint compared with the silver foil is a greatly simplified processing. Pieces to be welded quickly stick together after the evaporation of the solvent. The manipulation of the samples is thus made easier.

These faces were quickly manually pressed against each other before the solvent evaporated. Since the silver paint makes the different pieces sticking together, complex-shape samples with multi-junctions can be easily constructed. The thickness of the silver layer was optically observed to be about 50 to 60˚ m depending on the painting conditions. The sample was then subjected to a heat treatment. The sample was first heated rapidly to a temperature of 990¡C and maintained at this temperature for 1 h. This step was followed by a slow cooling ramp (0.5¡C/h) to 950¡C in order to induce an efficient recrystallization of the material around the junction.

The microstructural quality of the joined samples was analysed with a polarised-light optical microscope (Olympus Vanox AHMT3) and a SEM-EDX (Philips XL30 FEG-ESEM). The superconducting properties were characterised by micro Hall Probe Mapping in liquid nitrogen. The Hall probe active area was 0.1˚mm by 0.1˚mm and the measurements were performed with a 0.5˚mm step on a 25˚mm x 25˚mm scanned surface at 1˚mm from the sample top surface. The sample is magnetised following a Field Cooling (FC) procedure using an air coil providing an applied magnetic field of 0H = 380 mT in liquid nitrogen.

A junction along a plane perpendicular to the c-axis (usual configuration of junction) is shown in figure 2(A), and one in an ab-plane in figure 2(B). In both cases, it can be observed that the junctions are very clean. No secondary phase has been observed. Polarised light microscopy confirms that the junctions are well textured.

      "confirms that the junctions are well textured. The junction porosity is a little bit higher in the central part than near the edge of the single-domain. This porosity is probably due to impurities contained in the silver paint, to residual solvent traces, or to air trapping during the pressing. In addition, by performing electronic microscopy in Back-Scattered Electron mode (BSE), no silver particle was found. Furthermore EDX measurements did not highlight the presence of silver in the ceramics near the junction. This might be due to the fact that sensitivity of EDX detection is however limited for light elements, such as silver, in a heavy matrix, here DyBaCuO. Nevertheless both results suggest that the silver content in the sample is very small, probably smaller than 1 to 2at%, and well distributed. B.

Intragrain, G, (filled symbols) and across the junction , J, (open symbols) measurements are presented on the same graph using a logarithmic scale for the resistivity axis. For intragrain and across the junction measurements, the onset critical temperature, Tc, is about 92 K, which is a reasonable value for Dy-123. The resistive transitions within a grain are rather narrow whatever the applied magnetic field. For across the junction measurements, the transition is widened.

      "the transition is widened. Remarkably however, in the absence of magnetic field, the transition width is less than 4 K. Only a small shouldering is observed on ρ(T) when measured across the junction. This behaviour is similar to that found by Doyle et al. [33,34]. This can be related to the junction weak link effect. Another reason for this shouldering in the 4 ρ(T) curves might be related to macrocracks in the sample. Recall that in the studied configuration, the injected current flows along the c-axis (as shown on figure 2). This corresponds to a geometry in which eventual macrocracks, usually directed parallel to the ab- planes, may impede the superconducting current flow. Indeed such macrocracks have been observed by optical microscopy after ρ(T) measurements run between the VJ contacts and not between the VG contacts. They may have induced a weak link effect responsible for a shouldering in the ρ(T) curve. Samples with junction in a plane parallel to the c-axis were characterised\n",

Samples with junction in a plane parallel to the c-axis were characterised by micro Hall probe mapping at T = 77 K (figure 4). The shape of the trapped field distribution exhibits one single peak and no decrease of the trapped field near the junction. Although Hall Probe mapping results should be interpreted with great care when analysing a single grain boundary [34], it is not possible to give evidence for a weak link effect of the junction by this technique. Resistivity vs temperature measurements of samples with junction in a plane parallel to the c-axis are presented in figure 4. Intragranular (G) and across the junction (J) ρ(T) curve are plotted on the same graph, using a logarithmic scale for the resistivity axis.

The transition is narrow and the onset critical temperature, Tc, is about 91 K. This Tc value is slightly lower than the Tc of samples with a junction perpendicular to the c-axis (cf. figure 2). This small difference can be attributed to a better oxygenation in the case of the sample with junction perpendicular to the c-axis. The ρG˚(T) and ρJ˚(T) curves are very similar and very close to each other for all applied magnetic fields. No intermediate shoulder is observed on ρJ˚(T) curves, and these curves are only shifted by almost 0.2 K. Therefore the junction does not act as a weak link nor significantly affecting the critical current density.

Introduction Surface mount technology (SMT) is well-known as an essential method for electronic component assembly. The main operations in a surface mount assembly (SMA) line are stencil printing process (SPP), pick and place (P&P) and reflow soldering (for detail, see Fig. 1). A PCB stencil is aligned on the surface of the boards and solder paste is applied using a squeegee blade to ensure the pads are coated with a controlled amount of solder paste.

Then, the components are mounted onto the PCB boards in their respective positions by a P&P machine. Finally, the boards are passed through a reflow oven, in which the flux in the solder paste will evaporate and the solder paste will be melt into liquid, and then form solder joints to fix the electronic components on PCB boards. Except the three main processes mentioned above, the PCB boards in an SMA line need to be tested by a Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) machine, and one or two Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) machines to evaluate the quality of outcome for respective process. Mainly, SPI checks the quality of the solder paste after printing; Pre-AOI, which is located prior to the oven, takes charge of testing the placed components after P&P process.

Main processes of surface mount technology [1]. The P&P operations are applied on a Surface Mount Device (SMD), it is widely used in the electronics industry. When the component is placed on the wet solder paste, which could be considered as a temporary adhesive [2], it is to be held in position by the tackiness of solder paste [3]. However, the position of the placed component might be changed before entering the heating stage.

      "it will slump more or less during the P&P process. Also, if the component is placed poorly on the solder paste or the solder paste is too thin, too thick or too unbalanced etc., other forces will act on the placed component and could cause the component to shift on the wet solder paste. Besides, many other indirectly potential factors can lead to component shifts, such as machine’s vibration, PCB board’s oblique, conveyor’s instability. In practice, component shifts in P&P process are often underestimated because its tiny amount of the measured distance and the following reflow soldering is considered as a standard way to make up the shifts and placement errors [4]. However, with the desire of low defective rate in SMT, and the decreasing size of the electronic components, component shift in P&P process is no more ignorable, e.g., the tiny shifts may bring out significant misalignment for the small components.

The Behavior of Component Position in Pick and Place Process For each experimental setting, we repeat 20 placements of the same type of the components on one PCB board to verify the stability and repeatability. In Fig. 4, the black rectangle represents the designed position of the capacitor chip 0402 in setting 1, and the light blue rectangles signify the tested positions of 20 placements with the same setting.

As shown in Fig. 4, Fig 5 and Table 4, component shifts in P&P process is still significantly considerable. A few of shift 𝑌s are even greater than 10% of the component’s width. Moreover, the variation of shift 𝑌 is also quite large, whereas shift 𝑋 and Angle are relative stable because their standard deviations are smaller and vary little over different settings. However, it is noted that a certain shift 𝑋 and Angle are also having large distances from the expected location. For example, in Fig. 5(c), the average shift of the angles is 2.7° and substantially different from the ideal case (=0°). Table 4.\n",

The main effects analysis and the multiple polynomial regression method are used to test the effect of each factor and to build the mathematical model respectively. 4.1.

The average values of all samples studied at the respective levels are plotted on the 𝑦-axis. Due to space limitation, we select the main effects plots of the biggest capacitor C0402 and show it in Fig. 6. Other components show similar results to C0402. It is obvious to see that the offsets of the solder paste, the designed offsets of the component and average volume contribute more to the component shifts, which vary little with the change of the difference in volume and placement pressure. An interesting thing could be found in Fig. 6(c) is the component’s designed Angle & component shift Angle displays a nearly linear relationship. This indicates when the designed Angle of the component increases, the component shift Angle will decrease linearly. 4.2.

Regression analysis To verify the identification for the contribution of the factors and the responses numerically, we consider multivariate regression analysis [5]. As a preprocessing of the data collected from the lab experiment, we first remove the outliers regarding our three responses: shift 𝑋, shift 𝑌 and shift Angle. To detect the outlier, we use Tukey’s fences which is the most popular statistical technique to set the interquartile range of the acceptance region of the data Secondly, we standardize the data to reduce multicollinearity, especially for higher-order polynomial regression term. Lastly, in order to consider different sizes of components into the same scale, we use ratios of the offsets, shifts, solder paste area, and the solder paste volume, instead of actual values.

𝑅!, adjusted 𝑅! and predicted 𝑅! are used to measures the proportion of variability in component shift that can be explained by the factors. We represent the results of the regression analysis in Table 5. The variability of shift Angle is explained well in both the full quadratic model and the full cubic model, the 𝑅!, adjusted 𝑅! and predicted 𝑅! are close to or greater than 70%. However, the variance of shift 𝑋 and shift 𝑌 are not addressed well in the quadratic model, in which the three types of 𝑅! values are no more than 40%.

Conclusions In this paper, we have studied the component shift: 𝑥, 𝑦, and rotation (e.g., angular variation) in P&P process of SMT. According to the data acquired from the lab experiment, it can be shown that the component shift is not as small as to be neglected since a certain amount of the shifts are distributed far from the expected position. Particularly, a few of shift 𝑌s are more than 10% of component’s width. The results of main effects and regression analysis indicate that the position of solder paste, the designed position of the component, relative distances and average volume of\n",

      "of component’s width. The results of main effects and regression analysis indicate that the position of solder paste, the designed position of the component, relative distances and average volume of solder paste have the significant influence on the component shift occurred in P&P process. Also, the component type is another important factor which can be seen in Table 6. Besides, shift angle is nearly negative proportional with the designed angle of the component. The preliminary results are valuable for the study of component shift in P&P process. Although we could determine the contributing factors, it is still challenging to state these factors will definitely cause the component to shift. To establish a clear determination of the shifts, we will extend the scope of the involved factors to machinery and inspectional accuracy. Thus, it will encompass more factors to better describe the component shift in P&P process and help us to reduce the unexpected shift which may cause\n",

Table 2 IoT Attacks in Perceptual layer Security. Table 2 Issue Description Node Tempering In the event that an adversary is able to obtain physical access to sensor nodes, they will be able to replace the hardware or connect directly in order to either gain access or alter sensitive information [14]. It's possible that the sensitive information includes encryption keys or routing table routes. Fake Node Hackers can inject malicious data into IoT systems by creating a fake node, causing low-power devices to consume energy [31]. It also attacks as a man in the middle. Side Channel Attack Attackers exploit power, time, and electromagnetic radiation from sensor nodes to breach encryption [31]. Physical attack IoT devices can be physically damaged by attackers for denial of service (DoS) attacks, especially in open and closed environments. Code injection malice An adversary gains illegal access to a system by physically compromising a node and inserting malicious code [32]. Sensor Data Security Sensor data confidentiality is relatively low since adversaries can readily intercept the data. However, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of this data is of paramount importance. Mass-Node authentication Authentication problems are prevalent among numerous nodes within an IoT system [33]. The substantial volume of network communication required for authentication procedures can have adverse effects on system performance. Table 3 IoT Attacks in Network layer security. Table 3 Issue Description Heterogeneity problem The IoT perceptual layer encompasses a diverse range of technologies. Within this layer, the access network accommodates multiple access methods, creating a significant challenge in ensuring both security and interoperability [34]. Network Congestion Network congestion can result from various factors, such as the substantial volume of sensor data and the communication overhead generated by numerous devices authenticating themselves, among other reasons [34]. This issue could potentially be addressed through the implementation of a practical device authentication mechanism and the utilization of efficient transport protocols. RFIDs Interference This type of attack, which targets the network layer, entails disrupting the radio frequency signals employed by RFIDs by introducing noise signals, ultimately leading to a denial of service [35]. Jamming This type of attack bears similarities to radio frequency interference, as previously discussed in the context of RFIDs. In this attack, the malicious actor interferes with the radio frequency used by wireless sensor networks to disrupt their ability to offer services [36]. It represents another variation of a denial-of-service attack. Sniffing Attack This activity is commonly referred to as \"sniffing\" and involves the interception of wireless traffic in the vicinity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), RFIDs, or Bluetooth devices. Since the device layer in IoT primarily relies on wireless communication, attackers often initiate their attacks by first gathering information through the process of sniffing. Various specialized tools, such as packet sniffers, are employed for this purpose [37]. RFID Spoofing In this attack, the intruder gains unauthorized access to the system by mimicking RFID signals and reading the RFID tag. Subsequently, they transmit counterfeit data while using the original RFID tag [4] Route attacks Attackers can alter routing information and distribute it in the network, causing loops, false routes, error messages, or traffic drop [38]. Sybil Attack In Sybil attack, a single malicious node impersonates multiple nodes. This node can cause harm by distributing false routing information or disrupting the WSN election process [38]. Table 4 IoT Attacks in Support layer Security. Table 4 Issue Description Data Security Maintaining data confidentiality and security in the cloud requires protection from breaches. This can be achieved through tools for detecting cloud data migration, preventing data loss, and monitoring file and database activity. Cloud data security can be achieved through data dispersion and fragmentation [9]. Portability, Interoperability Interoperability and portability among cloud vendors are major issues today. Cloud migration can be challenging due to proprietary standards used by different vendors. This heterogeneity increases security risks [9]. Recovery and Continuity Cloud vendors must maintain services during natural disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes. Business continuity clouds should be located in a location that is least affected by disasters. It should follow the quick response team approach. Clouds should have data backup plans [9]. Audit Cloud The Cloud Security Alliance establishes standards for cloud vendors, requiring ongoing audits to ensure compliance and build user trust. Tenant Safety It is possible for several users’ data to be kept on the same physical drive in the cloud or for data to be shared by tenants, who are users of IaaS. An adversary could steal tenant data due to the shared physical media. Virtual Security Virtualization processes can differ from provider to provider of cloud services. It is important to ensure that virtualization is secure. Some virtual machine communication may circumvent network security controls [9]. For there to be no problems with cloud auditing, virtual machine migration needs to be secure. Table 5 IoT Attacks in Application layer Security. Table 5 Issue Description Data Authentication and Access In applications with multiple users possessing different access privileges, it is essential to implement authentication and access control measures at the application layer [39]. Phishing attack Adversaries employ infected emails or web links to illicitly obtain valid user credentials, thereby gaining unauthorized access [40]. Malicious Active X Scripts An adversary has the capability to compromise the system by transmitting an Active X script to the IoT user over the internet, prompting the user to execute it [5]. Malware attack Attackers can employ malware to pilfer data or disrupt applications through denial of service. Adversaries utilize threats like Trojan horses, worms, and viruses as means to exploit vulnerable systems [5]. Table 6 Comparison of different Vulnerabilities and Threads in IoT.

Key Findings Advantages Disadvantages [71] The study suggests a mutual authentication and session key generation strategy for IoT applications. The present study addresses IoT system issues such high computation and communication costs, lack of access level determination, and smart card theft susceptibility. The scalability of the proposed solution with regard to managing a substantial quantity of IoT devices and services is not addressed in the study. [72] The suggested method zones the network and connects nodes using two keys inside and between zones. The lightweight authentication operation for intra-zone communication reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency The research does not discuss how network size, node density, or dynamics may affect approach performance and security. [73] The proposed method includes an authentication protocol to authenticate cluster heads before sending information, preventing malicious nodes in the network Provides a regular structure for the transfer of information within the cluster and keys to secure the information exchanged in subsequent communications The author does not Extend the proposed security method to other networks, including mobile networks. [60] The scheme utilizes temporary identities generated by the central server using a master key during the device registration process. The paper introduces the concept of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and highlights their advantage in generating unpredictable outputs, which can contribute to the overall security of the scheme The analysis of attack scenarios in the paper is limited to an informal discussion and does not include a formal security analysis or experimental validation [74] The smart cabin lighting system is designed with four features: automatic control of lighting devices around people, touch keypad control, app control, and data collection for analysis Offers a cost-effective and energy-efficient ship cabin smart lighting system design. Potential privacy concerns or considerations pertaining to the accumulation and analysis of data from the smart lighting system are not addressed in the paper. [75] The paper proposes a lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol for IoT-based smart healthcare systems, addressing the security concerns associated with IoT devices in healthcare. Addresses the security concerns associated with IoT devices in healthcare, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of patient data The research makes no mention of real-world implementation or validation of the recommended methodology in an actual smart healthcare system, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings. [76] The paper discusses the impact of embedding watermarks on recognition accuracy in iris biometric authentication and highlights the need for comparative evaluations between watermarked and watermark-free systems The proposed approach of embedding iris biometric watermarking offers high security, resistance to attacks, and non-intrusiveness, enhancing the overall security and robustness of authentication systems The technology and methodology utilized to integrate iris biometric watermarking are not examined in the study. [77] This paper proposes a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) that generates and maintains healthcare certificates using blockchain technology. For security, the distributed application integrates blockchain with IoT-based medical devices. It also secures by specifying smart contract rules. The technology and methodology utilized to integrate is highly computational overhead are not examined in the study. Table 8 Summary of researches in the area of access control and data privacy. Table 8 Ref. Contributions Advantages Limitations [92] Access control solutions in a cloud computing environment are categorized by authors using various classifications. Furthermore, they provided a performance evaluation of various access control models. It examine the relationships between models and technologies, application scenarios, and pros and cons. It also discuss emerging access control issues and cloud computing research directions. The authors only dealt with the access control model as a standard. They didn't deal with the stages and nature of access control. [93] The authors suggested several access control categories, one of which is related to blockchain technology, notably smart contracts and transactions. Furthermore, they specified the precise application domain and blockchain platform used for each project. It is an in depth discussion of blockchain taxonomy, application/use-cases, consensus mechanisms, prospective research, future directions, and related technologies. It also discusses the pros, cons, and opportunities of blockchain technology with IoT security. The authors ignored access control criteria such as access control models, stages, and natures. Furthermore, the blockchain platform, hardware, and performance parameters are included in the implementation criteria. [94] The authors presented a classification system for authentication using blockchain technology: Access management based on smart contracts and on transactions. This article explains IoT security and privacy with block chain. It also discussed how blockchain technology can improve IoT applications by providing security solutions. The survey did not contain the comparison criteria for access control, as well as general factors like implementation and evaluation. [95] This literature review covers blockchain-based IoT access control, VANET, healthcare, and supply chain network privacy and security methods. It evaluates methods for scalability, privacy, extensibility, accuracy, storage overhead, and computation overhead. The authors failed to differentiate between blockchain technology requirements and access control criteria. [96] The authors presented a classification scheme for authentication that makes use of blockchain. Both transaction-based and smart-contract-based access controls are included in this classification system. This paper covers device security, data collection and sharing, and industrial application. It also examine IIoT blockchain platform technical requirements. The comparison was based solely on two criteria: implementation and security levels. [97] In order to implement access control in IoT systems utilizing blockchain technology, the authors defined particular characteristics of access control.

With the help of the IoT, physical objects can be given the ability to generate, receive, and seamlessly trade data with one another. The IoT includes a wide variety of applications, each of which focuses on automating a specific task and works to give inanimate objects the ability to act independently of human intervention. The currently available and upcoming IoT applications hold a great deal of promise for enhancing the level of convenience, productivity, and automation enjoyed by users. High levels of security, privacy, authentication, and the ability to recover from attacks are required for the implementation of such a world in a manner that is constantly expanding. In this light, it is necessary to make the necessary adjustments to the architecture of IoT applications to accomplish end-to-end security in IoT environments. In this article, a comprehensive review of the security-related challenges and potential sources of danger posed by IoT applications is provided. Following a discussion of security concerns, a variety of new and established technologies that are focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the applications of the IoT are covered. Machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, and blockchain are just a few of the technologies that help the IoT provide greater security. Keywords Internet of Things Blockchain Scalability Data Security Edge computing Authentication schemes 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the disruptive technologies of the 21st century that has revolutionized every business dimension across the globe. The Internet has become an essential component in daily activities such as e-commerce, e-learning, e-conferences, etc. According to [1], the number of IoT devices deployed may exceed 21.3 billion by 2022. Intelligent interfaces connect IoT devices in order to collaborate, gather, communicate, and store data. Deploying IoT devices enhances business productivity by optimizing operational procedures and maximizing the utilization of available resources. IoT brings innovation in the way things are monitored and managed remotely with the help of real-time data acquired from the sensors. With the unrestrained volumes of data generated by billions of connected devices, storage, management, and security are arduous. Security aspects such as authentication, authorization, privacy, confidentiality, availability, and integrity form the basis for information exchange in a trusted environment. Authentication is the process of identifying the genuineness of an entity. The authorization process allows only authenticated users to access the resources. The protection of privacy prevents hackers from accessing the user's private information. Data confidentiality is an outcome of authentication and authorization. It prevents sensitive data from being reclaimed and exploited. A device's availability confirms that IoT devices and services are resilient to attacks and are accessible all the time. Data integrity is the process of providing a tamper-proof platform for information communication, exchange, and storage. 1.1 Motivation The IoT needs to gain users’ trust before it can be widely used in business. To earn the trust of its users, the IoT must guarantee the users’ complete privacy and security. There is a very limited amount of published work that examines the security of the IoT, despite the fact that it is a very active research topic. On the other hand, the work is not current. Due to the fact that new threats in the IoT are discovered on a regular basis, we felt the need to conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of IoT security in order to provide researchers with direction regarding the efforts that are required in particular security areas. There is no discussion of support layer security in the IoT in any of the reviews that are currently available. Through the identification and discussion of a large number of support layer security issues in our paper, we were able to close the gap. The authentication and control of access are significant security challenges in the IoT, and a lot of work has been done in this area. We present an analysis of the most recent authentication and access control mechanisms in the IoT. 1.2 Contribution Among all the applications of the IoT, healthcare applications are the most important. The IoT has played a vital role in the sharing of various medical resources, making it an essential factor in the field of medicine. Today, information is shared freely across different networks, making it easy for practitioners and institutions to work with the available resources and deliver on the medical needs of society. However, recent advancements in technology have developed smart and intelligent IoT devices connected to the Internet that continuously transmit data. So providing security and privacy to this data in IoT is a very challenging task, which is to be considered the highest priority for several current and future applications of IoT. Security schemes in the IoT provide unauthorized access to information or other objects by protecting against alterations or destruction. Privacy schemes maintain the right to control the collected information for its usage and purpose. In this paper, we have surveyed major challenges such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability for IoT, briefly concerning remote health monitoring applications. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of existing access control solutions for IoT that addresses the above issues in existing survey papers. Our goal is to identify open challenges in existing authorization and access control solutions to drive the research and development of more effective access control solutions for IoT. The main contributions to our survey are the following: • Developing a Framework for Systematic and Comparative Analysis of Authorization, Access Control, and Scalability Solutions for IoT: This framework comprises a set of prerequisites that IoT authorization solutions should fulfill, along with defined criteria for their evaluation. • A review of several recent authorization frameworks for IoT and their evaluation with respect to the requirements and criteria in the framework. • Creating Guidelines for the Design of an Access Control Framework Tailored to the Specific Requirements and Constraints of prevalent IoT Applications. • There are currently unresolved difficulties in authenticating IoT devices and implementing scalable access control solutions. 1.3 Survey method In order to conduct our survey, we begin by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the key features of IoT systems and the technologies that support them. This analysis is based on an extensive review of existing literature and the latest advancements in the field of IoT. Our analysis has shown that cloud computing and edge computing are commonly utilized as fundamental technologies in the IoT to streamline the administration of devices and resources within IoT ecosystems. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the ways in which these computing paradigms have been modified for the IoT. Through the analysis of practical situations, we ascertain a collection of non-functional prerequisites for IoT systems. Based on these outlined requirements, we distill specific criteria that authorization solutions for IoT must meet. These criteria encompass essential tasks within the access control process, spanning policy definition, administration, assessment, and implementation. To gauge the alignment of existing authorization frameworks with these identified requirements, we scrutinize the features of the IoT ecosystems in which these frameworks operate. This examination involves a thorough analysis of IoT architecture styles, communication protocols, and data formats to grasp the inherent assumptions of the IoT environment. Particular attention is given to understanding the capabilities of nodes and their interconnections. Additionally, we delve into the characteristics of proposed authorization frameworks, encompassing the access control model, policy evaluation strategy, and deployment configuration. In our critical assessment, we evaluate multiple contemporary authorization frameworks tailored for the IoT against the specified requirements and criteria. We also gauged the suitability of these solutions for typical IoT applications. Our literature review has yielded valuable insights, guiding us in identifying significant trends and pointing towards emerging research avenues in the realm of access control for the IoT. Notably, our observations highlight a rising interest in crafting authorization frameworks explicitly designed for IoT systems. However, it is evident that many proposed frameworks aim to provide a one-size-fits-all solution to address authorization challenges in the IoT landscape. Our analysis underscores that diverse IoT applications exhibit unique requirements, emphasizing the absence of a universal solution capable of accommodating all scenarios. Therefore, the development of an IoT-tailored authorization framework should meticulously consider the distinctive requirements and limitations inherent to the specific IoT application under consideration. The subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an introductory explanation of IoT. In Section 3, a summary of the technology that makes IoT possible follows this with respect to provide security. In Section 4, we analyze the fundamental functional and non-functional prerequisites for IoT systems authentication and contributions made in authentication systems in the literature. Finally, the Section 4 concluded with open research issues related to IoT device authentication. In Section 5, we outline the primary criteria that IoT access control and privacy frameworks must meet, and in Section 6, we assess the frameworks with respect to scalability issues and existing solutions with research gaps. We then provide a conclusion to the paper at Section 70, by highlighting unresolved matters and propose areas for future research. 2 Technology behind IoT IoT is not a single technology but a blend of multiple technologies. Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) are the four technologies on which the IoT technology is based on big data analytics, cloud computing, and embedded systems, which are the technologies that enable building IoT applications. M2M technology, also known as the Internet of Devices, is used to capture events using a network connection and forward them to a central server. This server translates these events into meaningful information and uses it according to the specific applications. RFID, also known as the Internet of Objects, is a technology that uses simple, low-cost contactless disposable cards to store numbers and other attributes. These chips contain antennas, and using RFID readers, this data can be retrieved. WSN, also known as the Internet of Transducers, is used for sensing and collecting data from the environment where the devices are installed and then forwarding the acquired data to the central authorities. Computer systems monitor and regulate processes in industrial control systems using SCADA technology. SCADA uses Human Machine Interfaces (HCI), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) to achieve this task. With billions of devices installed across the globe, enormous amounts of data are generated. Storing and managing such a large volume of data is a tedious process. \"Big data\" is a technology that is designed to store, analyze, and manage large volumes and varieties of data that arrive at different velocities. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that provides applications and services to its users over the Internet. It provides resources for computing, networking, and storing resources on-demand as a metered service. Different services offered on the cloud computing platform include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Embedded systems are smaller, hardware-based systems that are used to control larger systems. They use modules such as microprocessors/microcontrollers, memory modules, networking, digital signal processing, and graphical processors to accomplish different application-specific functions. Commercial-of-The-Shelf (COTS) modules are also used in some high-end applications where real-time processes are modeled with maximum precision and high operational accuracy. Network processors and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are also used in some domain-specific IoT applications. 2.1 IoT layered architecture Numerous authors and researchers have proposed diverse IoT architectures, with a common focus on a three-layer architecture [2]. Typically, the fundamental structure of IoT can be categorized into three primary layers: the application layer, the network layer, and the perception layer, as illustrated in the Fig. 1 [2]. The research community acknowledges that [3] is the most recent and widely used IoT architecture, which starts with the presentation of the three-layered structure. Subsequently, we delve into an exploration of additional layers that extend this architecture into a five-layered model. Perception layer: Within this layer, diverse devices establish connections, encompassing physical devices like sensors, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Bluetooth, as well as virtual devices such as barcodes, Quick Response (QR) codes, and Global Positioning System (GPS). This layer's primary function involves the aggregation of data from end nodes and its subsequent transmission to the network layer. These devices within this layer are typically acknowledged as resource-constrained. Network layer: This layer is responsible for gathering data transmitted by the end nodes of the perception layer and facilitating its transfer to the application layer. Its core duty lies in establishing connectivity with the devices integrated into the perception layer, employing various technologies such as 4 G and Wi-Fi. Additionally, it ensures the security of information received from the perception layer by implementing robust security mechanisms to safeguard against potential attacks. Application layer: Within this layer, end-users engage with applications tailored to their specific requirements. Services are provided in accordance with the users’ needs, allowing them to interact with technology based on the functionalities of the end nodes. In addition to the foundational 3-layer architecture, we also observe the emergence of intermediate architectures, culminating in a 5-layered IoT architecture as detailed in the reference [3]. These additional layers focus on data processing originating from the perception layer and on aspects of system management. The transition is illustrated in Fig. 1, depicting a sequence of critical elements in IoT architectural designs: identification, sensing, communication, computation, services, and semantics. It is evident that the initial step in IoT processes is device identification. Consequently, authenticating and verifying the devices within the perception layer hold significant importance in IoT applications. 2.2 IoT applications The IoT enables machine-to-machine, human-to-human, and machine-to-human communication. Recent advancements in IoT systems have had a favorable influence on individuals’ daily activities, ranging from information access to real-time service delivery. The IoT has altered how humans interact with technology, with far-reaching implications for daily living, industry, and society as a whole. Its importance rests in a number of crucial areas, including ubiquitous computing, smart automation, remote applications, and so on. The potential of the IoT to integrate smoothly into daily life, automate and improve decision-making processes, deliver customized experiences, and open up new avenues for innovation and sustainability is the primary reason for the relevance of the IoT in human engagement with technology. As IoT technology continues to advance, it is anticipated that its influence on human engagement with technology will become more profound. This highlights the significance of tackling the issues that accompany it in order to fully achieve the potential benefits that it offers. IoT connects objects to the internet and to one another, allowing for hitherto inconceivable levels of interaction and data sharing. This pervasive connectivity enables seamless integration of technology into daily things, making human-technology interaction more intuitive and natural. IoT creates new chances for creative services and business models. For example, the capacity to monitor items in real-time leads to models such as \"Product as a Service,\" in which firms charge based on consumption rather than selling the product itself. This transformation can result in more sustainable consumption patterns and new revenue sources for businesses. IoT devices are critical for environmental monitoring, including tracking pollution levels, water quality, and wildlife migrations. This information can help guide conservation activities and policies aimed at ensuring sustainability. Furthermore, IoT can improve resource utilization in enterprises and residences, thereby increasing energy efficiency and reducing waste. The IoT is a technology that allows inanimate objects to act autonomously in order to improve efficiency, convenience, and quality of life. By integrating sensors, software, and other technologies, IoT enables these objects to gather and exchange data and perform tasks without human input. The technology also provides comprehensive environmental data collection and analysis for better decision-making. In agriculture, for example, IoT sensors can measure soil moisture, ambient temperature, and plant health to optimize watering and fertilization programs for greater resource efficiency and crop yields. IoT-capable machines can monitor their own operating state and anticipate potential issues, scheduling maintenance at optimal times to reduce downtime and extend equipment lifespan. IoT solutions can also automatically respond to risks and inconsistencies, improving safety and security. Security frameworks powered by the IoT can instantly alert authorities or take pre-set actions to address hazards. IoT devices can automate tedious and time-consuming tasks, improving quality of life. Automated home systems, voice-activated controls, and emergency alerting systems powered by IoT give elderly and disabled individuals more independence. Additionally, IoT can customize device functionalities to match user habits and preferences, providing a more personalized experience across entertainment, healthcare, and commerce. The IoT can be utilized in many different aspects of life, both in the private and public sectors. With IoT, people can track lost pets, monitor their house's security system, and keep track of appliance maintenance schedules. Consumers can use IoT to make restaurant reservations, monitor their exercise progress and overall health, and receive coupons for stores they pass by. Businesses can use IoT to monitor supply chains, track customer spending habits, collect feedback, maintain inventory levels, and engage in predictive maintenance of their machines and devices. The IoT is also helpful in IT service management, which is an essential detail since IT departments are called upon to do more in a digital world with more reliance on wireless networks. Blockchain, a more efficient and secure method of transaction and data processing, is also a natural beneficiary of IoT technology. Thus, we can expect to see IoT and Blockchain working together more frequently in the future. The digitalization of things has drastically increased over the past few years and has been made possible through cheap resources that are now available to everyone. IoT grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the rising penetration of smart analytics and remote monitoring. There has also been a strong shift over the last decade from non-IoT devices to IoT devices. In fact, it is expected that 75% of all devices will be IoT by 2030. The IoT has been smoothly integrated into many aspects of our globalized economy and way of life, from interconnected consumer products such as appliances, security systems, and automobiles to big manufacturing applications such as those in agribusiness and power. As the number of connected devices grows, businesses must find the most effective ways of ensuring cybersecurity in a technology-driven world. 2.3 Need for security in IoT The security of traditional systems remains a pervasive concern, with the ongoing reliance on traditional frameworks for development lacking specific standards. Technologies that continue to rely on these frameworks are particularly vulnerable to security threats. As the IoT market expands, safeguarding company data and intellectual property becomes increasingly critical. Ensuring the security of IoT devices requires developers to adhere to the following key services:. Authentication: The upcoming challenge for IoT revolves around authenticating IoT users, a task that has become more intricate with the introduction of new standards and self-configuring protocols, in contrast to the relatively simpler traditional approaches. Utilizing two-factor authentication, such as Google's two-step notification, offers some degree of control over applications, especially when utilizing the widely used mobile devices. The attributes that render smartphones effective authentication factors are the very characteristics that will empower devices like watches, wristbands, and thermostats to form opinions about our identity and assert that opinion. Confidentiality: The most recent technologies make messages susceptible to interception by outside parties in the IoT world. For instance, when a user accesses their homecare application from a public Wi-Fi network at a restaurant, live video content from their home becomes vulnerable to access by unauthorized third parties on the same network. Hence, ensuring confidentiality is paramount, and messages must remain concealed from intermediate entities. End-to-End (E2E) message secrecy emerges as a crucial requirement in the IoT landscape. Additionally, stored data, encompassing messages and personal information on IoT devices, must be safeguarded from unauthorized entities. Data Integrity: Remarkably, a significant portion of IoT research has directed its focus towards privacy, recognizing it as a crucial element in ensuring a secure IoT environment. Within any application, integrity stands out as a paramount component, surpassing even availability in importance. This emphasis is particularly critical in scenarios such as medical devices or a car's braking system, where a compromise in integrity could potentially result in severe consequences, even costing lives. Over the years, both Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) have played pivotal roles in ensuring data security, each with its own distinct and complementary functions. PKI excels in authentication and facilitating secure communication over networks, while KSI serves as a robust solution for ensuring integrity. Access Control: In conventional systems, access controls are typically designed for closed systems, where all users are familiar entities within the system. Given the significant role that unidentified entities play in the IoT, the approach needs to take into account both open and closed systems. Access control involves three decision factors along with two decision properties. 2.4 Need for communication security Implementing the security services mentioned in the previous section will help secure communication in the IoT, which is essential. The utilization of standardized security mechanisms enables the provision of communication security across various layers. Table 1 illustrates an IoT stack with standardized security solutions implemented at different layers. Link Layer: The most recent state-of-the-art security solution for the IoT is IEEE 802.15.4′s link layer security. This link-layer security operates on a per-hop basis, ensuring that each node in the communication path is trusted. A single pre-shared key is employed to safeguard all communication within this framework. In the event of a compromise, where an attacker gains access to one device and a key, the impact is limited to a single hop or device. This per-hop security approach not only minimizes the extent of potential compromise but also allows for detection at an early stage. While link layer security has its limitations, its flexibility is noteworthy, enabling it to operate seamlessly with multiple protocols across different layers. Network Layer: In the context of IoT, which is predominantly implemented over the internet, it relies on network IP Security (IPsec) provided at the network layer. IPsec delivers end-to-end security encompassing authentication, confidentiality, and integrity. Operating at the network layer, IPsec is compatible with various transport layer protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, and CoAP. Through the use of the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) protocol, IPsec ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the IP payload. Simultaneously, the Authentication Header (AH) protocol guarantees the integrity of both the IP header and payload. Notably, IPsec has become mandatory in all IPv6 protocols, signifying that all IPv6-ready devices inherently possess default support for IPsec. Data Security: Ensuring the security of communication is paramount in IoT, yet many application developers overlook the importance of securing the data generated by IoT devices. A significant challenge arises from the small size of most IoT devices, which imposes constraints on implementing robust security measures due to limited resources. While various solutions exist, the diverse communication technologies employed in the IoT suggest that a single solution may not suffice to comprehensively secure every aspect. 3 Security in IoT The significant impact of the IoT on daily life has spurred extensive research efforts aimed at enhancing its benefits for humanity. Numerous researchers have undertaken surveys to elucidate the intricacies of the IoT ecosystem. While some studies have focused on providing an overview of the challenges confronting IoT, others have delved into the realm of security threats. Several works, including [4–8], have reviewed security threats in IoT, addressing various types of attacks. For instance, [6] specifically highlighted security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth, shedding light on potential attacks leveraging these vulnerabilities within the IoT context. The challenges posed by IoT have been explored by researchers in works such as [4,9]. Additionally, [10] presented security guidelines, and the impact of 5 G on IoT systems. The architectural aspects of IoT, including its layers, were the focal point of [11], while different protocols were discussed in various works like [12–14]. Diverse applications of IoT, exemplified by [8], emphasized the transformative impact of smart logistics in industries. Given the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, there is a need for efficient and lightweight operations. This led to investigations into how edge computing, as illustrated in references [15,16], can facilitate the processing of IoT services such as smart agriculture and smart logistics. Authentication frameworks can be conceptualized through centralized methods or decentralized mechanisms, with decentralized solutions leveraging blockchain technology gaining attention in the research community, as evident in various review papers like [17–19]. In the realm of smart mobile IoT architecture, diverse security mechanisms were expounded upon in [20]. Conversely, intrusion detection solutions based on machine learning were illustrated in [20–22]. Notably, our research distinguishes itself by providing a comprehensive review of IoT attacks, encompassing taxonomy, attack surfaces, security mechanisms, secure data communication methods, and more. Table 1 succinctly outlines the contributions of different review papers, highlighting the unique perspective our paper brings to the landscape compared to other survey papers. 3.1 IoT internal security architecture Despite the significant and extensive applications of IoT, its deployment in mission-critical domains presents formidable challenges, with paramount concerns related to security and privacy. For instance, a successful security breach in a smart healthcare system could result in the loss of numerous patient lives and substantial financial repercussions. Similarly, in the context of intelligent transportation systems, a security breach could lead to both financial losses and human casualties. Securing IoT is an intricate and demanding field, necessitating further research efforts to effectively address these challenges. In this section, we delve into these security challenges at the layer level, providing an illustrated overview of IoT node security, as depicted in the accompanying Fig. 2 . Perceptual layer Security: Perceptual layer consists of resource constrained IoT devices i.e. Sensors, RFID tags, Bluetooth and Zigbee devices. These devices are more prone to cyber-attacks. As large amount of IoT devices is physically deployed in open fields, it encounters many physical attacks, which are presented in Table 2 . It is crucial to secure the IoT system from physical access by adversaries. Additionally, node authentication is necessary to prevent unauthorized system access. To ensure data integrity and confidentiality between nodes, lightweight cryptographic algorithms should be designed for secure transmission. Improving key management is a challenge in the IoT context. Network Layer Security: Even though the core network has adequate security measures, there are some problems that still persist. The integrity and confidentiality of data may be compromised if traditional security flaws are not addressed. There are many different kinds of network attacks that are still affecting the network layer, such as eavesdropping attacks, denial of service attacks, man-in-the middle attacks, and virus invasions. The detailed IoT attacks in the network layer are presented in Table 3 . While core network security is mature, harmful IoT security concerns such as denial of service and distributed denial of service must be addressed at this layer. Communication protocols must be mature to address routing attacks, congestion, and spoofing security issues. Support Layer Security: The security of the support layer is not dependent on the security of other layers, and cloud computing security is an expansive field of security. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is responsible for the establishment of many standard cloud security frameworks. In addition to this, the development of a mechanism for continuous cloud audit, such as the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), and the provision of trusted results through Trusted computing (TCG) is being worked on. Because this layer hosts the data and applications used by IoT users, it is imperative that both be safeguarded against unauthorized access. At this layer of security, some of the concerns include the table [tab:tab3]. IoT users’ data and applications are stored on cloud and fog nodes. Cloud security and privacy should not be compromised. The CSA has established numerous security standards, laws, and regulations for cloud security. Continuous monitoring of security standards is necessary, and IoT systems should only use clouds that meet CSA standards. Additionally, users need a simple online cloud audit mechanism to build trust with their vendors. Application Layer Security: At the application layer, the various applications each have their own unique set of security requirements. There is currently no agreed-upon standard for the construction of IoT applications. On the other hand, one of the characteristics of the IoT application layer is the sharing of data. The sharing of data is fraught with difficulties regarding data privacy and access control. The table [tab:tab4] presents some of the more common concerns regarding application layer security. It is necessary to have a robust authentication and access control mechanism in order to deal with application layer security. In addition to these, it is essential to instruct users on the importance of using robust passwords. It is necessary to have powerful anti-virus software in order to protect against malware. 3.2 IoT security requirements IoT offers a lot of benefits, but it also brings some challenges. These challenges include concerns over privacy, security vulnerabilities, and the digital divide. As IoT evolves, it is important to ensure that devices are secure, user privacy is respected, and technology is accessible to all. Since IoT devices collect, transmit, and process vast amounts of data, including sensitive personal information, it is crucial to secure these devices and their ecosystems. Implementing IoT applications requires essential security requirements such as end-to-end encryption, access control, privacy, authentication, resilience against attacks, data integrity, and availability, among others. Implementing these requirements demands a holistic approach that encompasses not only the technological aspects but also the processes and people involved. Security, privacy, authentication, and resilience should be integral to the design and operation of IoT systems, following the principle of \"security by design\" to anticipate and mitigate risks from the outset. Hence, adjusting the architecture of IoT applications is necessary to address the unique security challenges posed by IoT environments, including the complexity of IoT ecosystems, diverse communication protocols, data privacy concerns, integration with legacy systems, the dynamic nature of IoT environments, and regulatory compliance requirements. By implementing end-to-end security measures, organizations can mitigate risks and protect sensitive data across the entire IoT ecosystem, from device to cloud. To ensure the security of equipment, it is imperative to comprehend the fundamental security objectives. Traditional security principles, as encapsulated in the CIA triad, include confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality entails defining rules that establish criteria for authorized entities with access to information. Integrity plays a crucial role in ensuring the delivery of trustworthy services by making sure that IoT devices only receive legitimate commands and data. Furthermore, availability ensures that IoT functionalities remain accessible to legitimate objects and users at all times and in all locations. In the realm of Information Assurance and Security (IAS-octave), a comprehensive framework, an expanded set of security goals are introduced to address the limitations of the CIA triad and provide a more encompassing approach to security. IAS-octave expands on the original OCTAVE framework by providing an expanded set of security goals. These goals are designed to address various aspects of information assurance and security within an organization. With respect to IoT security, these security requirements are defined as follows: • End-to-End Encryption: Data transmitted between IoT devices and servers should be encrypted to prevent interception and unauthorized access. • Access Control: Implement strong access controls to limit who can interact with the IoT system and under what conditions. • Privacy: Users should be informed about what data is collected, how it is used, and who it is shared with, allowing for informed consent. • Device Authentication: Securely authenticate devices before they join the network to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting. • Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious activity and potential security breaches. • Data Integrity Protection: Implement mechanisms to ensure that data has not been tampered with during transmission or storage. These security goals provide a framework for IoT to evaluate their current security posture, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies and initiatives to enhance information assurance and security capabilities. By addressing these goals comprehensively, organizations can mitigate risks, protect critical assets, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems. 3.3 IoT vulnerabilities IoT devices have become integral to delivering enhanced consumer experiences and are omnipresent in our surroundings. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has given rise toto an escalating threat landscape in terms of security. Hackers are exploiting the vast network of interconnected devices, potentially compromising sensitive data. In the absence of robust security measures, IoT devices are susceptible to data breaches. What makes this situation even more concerning is that IoT and cybercriminal activities often operate inconspicuously, beyond the scope of ordinary observation, posing a constant threat. Moreover, IoT devices are particularly vulnerable to attacks and security risks due to their inherent limitations, including their affordability, low power capabilities, limited computing resources, and the sheer heterogeneity and scale of the IoT network. The vulnerability of IoT devices is not solely attributed to technical factors but also extends to user behavior. These factors collectively contribute to the ongoing risks associated with these smart devices. • Limited computing capabilities and hardware constraints: IoT devices are typically designed for specific applications with minimal processing power, leaving little room for robust security and data protection measures. • Heterogeneous transmission technology: IoT devices communicate with various devices using diverse communication technologies, making it challenging to establish consistent protection measures and protocols. • Vulnerable device components: Insecure or outdated fundamental components can leave millions of smart devices susceptible to harm. • User security awareness: Many users lack sufficient knowledge about security, exposing IoT devices to potential risks and attack vectors. Additionally, the integration of third-party apps on IoT devices can introduce further vulnerabilities. • Weak physical security: Unlike the secured data centers of internet services, many IoT components are physically accessible not only to users but also to individuals with malicious intent, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and tampering. Security concerns in the realm of IoT can be categorized into two main types: software-level threats and hardware-level threats. Software-level attacks, such as hacking, information leakage, and illegal access, aim to disrupt system functionality and gather sensitive information like credit card details and passwords. Employing security measures like firewalls, keeping virus databases updated, and using the latest software versions can help mitigate software-based attacks. However, the security landscape extends beyond software vulnerabilities, as hardware-level attacks also pose a significant risk. Ensuring complete hardware security requires the development of secure Integrated Circuits (ICs) or Systems on Chips (SoCs). This task has become increasingly complex due to the intricate nature of nano-scale design, the distributed fabrication of embedded Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips, and the incorporation of third-party Intellectual Property (IP) cores. The insertion of a single malicious circuit during the fabrication process can compromise the entire system, and such intrusions may remain imperceptible to the original designers. Defects within the components of a system can create vulnerabilities that broaden the attack surface. Adversaries often seek to exploit both the hardware and software of IoT systems to carry out malicious activities. According to a report by HP, approximately 50% of commercially available IoT devices exhibit significant security flaws. It is imperative to proactively address and respond to the vulnerabilities mentioned earlier, as they have the potential to expose sensitive information and compromise IoT systems. Given the IoT network's susceptibility to various forms of attacks, conducting comprehensive security analysis and implementing foolproof security measures is a complex undertaking. However, the substantial volume of data generated within IoT environments also contributes to enhancing the overall security level of the system. 3.4 Thread model Threat modeling facilitates the discovery of security flaws in computer systems and business processes. The thread model ensures that the system is not exposed to any potential vulnerabilities, which results in a heightened awareness of potential threats to system security [41]. IoT device networks are susceptible to newer security threats as a result of the challenges and issues that are associated with these networks. The requirements for security should be addressed at both the device level and the application level. The necessary precautions differ from one application to the next, as well as between domains. IoT devices have a limited amount of resources, which means that they are easily exploitable and could potentially serve as an entry point to the network. Each device that is part of the network needs to be shielded so that there is less of a chance that there will be a breach in the network's data integrity. Because breaches in networks serving critical applications can endanger people's lives and cause financial harm, higher levels of security are required for those applications. Examples of such applications include healthcare and banking systems. In [42], the cyberattack known as BrickerBot targeted healthcare applications. Attackers were successful in compromising the medical device and destroying the memory and data it contained with the assistance of this middleware, which they used to initiate a brute force method of attack. Tables 4 and 5 The impact of security attacks on the data systems of the IoT can range from minor to severe damage. The summary of device-level vulnerabilities and possible threats is presented in Table 6 for a selection of domains, including healthcare, business, and smart cities. The exponential growth in the number of connected devices around the world presents a formidable obstacle for identity and access management. In order to construct a trusted operating environment in which untrusted IoT devices can communicate and share information over an unsecured channel, it is essential to establish mutual authentication between IoT devices and servers and other access points. 4 Authentication schemes Authentication is one of the time-consuming tasks involved in determining the legitimacy of a remote user on a public network. Authentication is a critically important component in the overall security architecture of IoT applications. The different types of authentication mechanisms are broken down and categorized in Fig. 3 . Authentication requirements shift between layers in a hierarchical structure. Authentication issues pertaining to key management, confidentiality, and integrity, as well as software for the middleware, are tackled in the application layer. The application layer has a number of problems, including identity theft disclosure, desynchronization attacks, and a lack of forward secrecy. Stolen passwords are another problem. A four-way handshake method has been developed using a token-based approach to provide perfect forward secrecy (PFS) in RFID-based systems [43]. Using this interactive protocol, devices can be mutually authenticated for legitimate interactions. Due to the low-resource nature of IoT networks, complex authentication mechanisms cannot be employed. Authors in [44,45] developed a lightweight protocol that can resist collision attacks and DoS attacks. This method is computationally and communication-wise expensive but can withstand known security attacks. As presented in [46], the process of authenticating RFID tags can be made more complicated so that it can withstand attacks involving false nodes and other forms of impersonation. The authors in [47] found that using handshake methods, low-intensity authentication, and key agreement schemes were effective ways to accomplish efficient authentication and build trust in the system. To meet the demanding requirements of IoT applications, lightweight authentication protocols are currently in the process of being developed. Considering that these applications can process things and exchange information without the intervention of a human, authentication is becoming an increasingly important factor [48]. Recently developed cryptographic hash functions that are based on the Lightweight New Mersenne Number Transform (LNMNT) are ideal for providing security for IoT applications because of their lightweight nature. According to [49], these functions offer effective performance in terms of the amount of memory used, the amount of energy consumed, and the speed at which they are executed. The IoT and cloud computing platforms are combined to deliver more potent services, such as those referred to as Exchange to Exchange (E2E) and Smart to Smart (S2S) services. The number of security breaches, on the other hand, rises as a direct consequence of this integration, highlighting the ongoing requirement for a data delivery system that is both lightweight and effective. The authors in [50] found that this enabled better communication between a pair of IoT devices while also reducing the amount of power consumed and providing mutual authentication. There is a need for augmentation methods due to the fact that high bitwidth cryptographic algorithms cannot be accommodated in IoT devices [51]. These methods involve the use of commercial processors that have high computational capabilities. Authentication mechanisms that are both effective and efficient are required for hierarchical IoT networks. In these networks, nodes must have the ability to directly access real-time data. In addition to passing all of the security validations, the model should be able to guarantee anonymity and incorporate a mechanism for automatically upgrading software [52]. At the physical layer, authentication from one device to another is nearly impossible due to the fact that compromised credentials, such as passwords, can make an attacker appear to be a legitimate user. [53] says that to stop these kinds of attacks, physical layer authentication schemes and standard cryptographic algorithms with low overhead must work together without any problems. Existing encryption algorithms can be modified so that they are compatible with IoT devices that have limited resources. The authors in [54] found that even after algorithms such as AES were altered to work with the new hardware, they still maintained the same high level of security. The novel requirements of advanced IoT applications are beyond the capabilities of many of the existing security algorithms. According to [55], identity-based mutual authentication schemes that make use of puncturable pseudo-random functions can meet the requirements of mobile clients operating in an IoT environment. Tampering with the device and installing replacement nodes are two examples of potential physical threats to physical IoT devices. The author in [56] suggests that multi-stage mutual authentication mechanisms should be implemented in order to prevent attacks of this nature. Increasing the level of internal and external hardware security within a network can help improve device authentication and ensure secure communication between the various entities that make up a network. Electronic circuits that are designed to function in only one direction are known as physical unclonable functions, or PUFs for short. It takes the same inputs but applies them at different time intervals, and as a result, it produces two distinct outputs. Because of this, it is difficult to \"clone\" them. Yanambaka et al. [57] found that a robust authentication scheme that uses hybrid oscillator arbiter PUF can set up an authentication mechanism that is both more reliable and more quickly established. A PUF-based three-factor authentication system that uses biometrics, smart cards, and passwords is proposed by Liu et al. in [58]. This technique offers tamper resistance for IoT devices at a low cost and requires only a moderate amount of memory resources for computations. In [59], the authors present a proposal for a mutual authentication protocol that makes use of a hybrid arbiter and ring oscillator PUF. The session keys are generated and saved locally, either on the device or the server, when utilizing this method. An adversary may create a proxy to imitate the device's behavior and gain unauthorized access to the network in this way. According to [60], resource-efficient PUFs are used in the modeling of the protocols that protect the integrity of IoT hardware and software. After going through a process of mutual authentication, the devices are then able to communicate with one another by using PUFs. When utilizing hardware-based security protocols, the vital metrics that need to be taken into consideration include the physical area of the PUF, the amount of energy that is consumed, and the rate at which keys are generated [61]. It is essential to have mechanisms in place to verify remote users in order to engage in trustworthy communication and data sharing. According to Zhao et al. in [62], PUFs can serve as a foundation for the identification of various types of devices. In addition to this, the PUFs can serve as a source for the generation of cryptographic keys. The authors in [63] found that SRAM memories can be used to derive secret keys, which can then be used for encryption and decryption procedures. Standard algorithms, such as AES, can be utilized, along with the keys that are generated by PUFs, in order to encrypt the data. The challenge-response (CR) pairs that are used for enrollment and other purposes such as validation and verification have the potential to become access points for model-based attacks. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of CR-pairs, the same encryption mechanisms can be utilized, as stated in [64]. In recent years, blockchain technology has garnered a lot of attention for its ability to provide a safe and reliable environment for the storage of data and the exchange of information. Through the utilization of digital contracts, the blockchain platform enables the safe transfer of data. These contracts are used to authenticate the users, which also provides role-based access control to the system. In some applications, like vehicular networks, broadcasting forged messages to attract user attention poses a threat to users’ privacy as well as their ability to authenticate themselves. According to Khan et al. in [65], it is of the utmost importance in anonymous networks to both discover the true identities of participants and protect their privacy. A blockchain is used to store the data so that its veracity as well as its privacy can be preserved. As a result, this system offers a protected framework through the utilization of a distributed blockchain network. The blockchain is entirely independent in that it does not involve any third parties in its operations. Before being allowed to share the data, the nodes and any other entities involved, therefore, have to carefully authenticate themselves. As mentioned in [66], effective methods of identity management and authentication are necessary in order to safeguard both the availability and integrity of data. In applications such as vehicular networks, traceability and the privacy of user data are both absolutely necessary. Pseudonyms and methods for tracing anonymous messages sent from malicious nodes are two of the techniques that are required in order to provide trusted communications in an environment where there is a lack of trust between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. According to Zheng et al. in [67], blockchain technology may be able to provide assistance in meeting these essential requirements. The medical and healthcare platforms are examples of domains that have made optimal use of the benefits and innovations offered by IoT networks, thereby realizing their full potential. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to the collection of medical devices that are connected to the internet. These devices contain sensors that are interfaced to them in order to collect vital patient body parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Depending on the device, the sensors send their collected data via wired or wireless communication networks to a central server. The physicians can use this information to evaluate the performance of the remote patient as well as the patient's current state of recovery, and they can also prescribe additional medication. By utilizing encryption and the built-in tamper-proof architecture that the blockchain \"citexu2019healthchain\" provides, a blockchain network enables the establishment of mutual authentication among users as well as data privacy. Innovation and healthcare go hand in hand, with the former being applied to medical diagnosis and treatment. As mentioned in [68], because every procedure in the system is saved as an immutable record, users are unable to make any changes to them. The healthcare applications include things like tracking devices used by patients, billing insurance companies, and settling payments with pharmacies. Authentication and privacy protection mechanisms are necessities for any negotiations to take place between these entities. Another study [69] suggests that the transaction speed within the blockchain needs to be increased in order to ensure smooth and trouble-free transactions within the network. The data gathered from patients by healthcare applications may be stored on-chain or off-chain, depending on the provider's preference. The paper [70] recommends exercising caution whenever data from this storage is shared in order to protect the confidentiality of the data and stop unauthorized access. Further, some important solutions that address the authentication issues have been summarized in Table 7 . 4.1 Open research dimensions in authentication Comparing existing surveys and looking at the different authentication methods and tools that make them work shows a number of useful research directions in the area of IoT and its security. The drawbacks associated with the discussed authentication methods across different sections underscore the necessity for ongoing research efforts as IoT applications continue to diversify. Addressing these shortcomings, contingent on the specific application domains, will be a crucial task for future researchers. These identified limitations serve as a foundation for defining research problems that must be tackled to enhance the maturity and sustainability of IoT security in the future. These open research problems offer valuable guidance for algorithm developers, industry professionals, and academia. Building upon the discussions in the preceding sections, here we provide a consolidated list of directions for future research endeavors. Architectural aspects: The review of research works underscores the prevalence of the three-layered architecture as the most widely adopted IoT framework. While other architectures are available, they have not received significant research attention thus far. The concept of a five-layered architecture emerges as a potential candidate for future IoT frameworks. Observations indicate that as IoT functionalities expand, designers introduce additional layers to accommodate various operations. These supplementary layers indeed provide finer granularity to the system. However, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dependencies to define security requirements effectively and apply appropriate methods. Therefore, it becomes imperative to thoroughly grasp the merits and drawbacks of these architectural choices, enabling the association of well-defined functions with each layer to harness their architectural advantages optimally. Security requirements: The authentication of both the sender and the data is a fundamental requirement for ensuring secure communication. In addition to this, employing an attestation process is essential to upholding both the integrity and authentication of the transmitted information. For instance, implementing remote attestation for IIoT-related patches and software updates is crucial. While several remote authentication methods are already in existence, there remains room for further advancements in this domain, particularly in the context of adopting decentralized frameworks. Decentralization aspects: Authentication is typically established through the use of digital signatures, which rely on cryptographic keys. In conventional systems, the process of key generation is centralized and susceptible to potential failures. Researchers have already commenced investigations into distributed key generation processes, but further advancements are required to make them applicable in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, in authentication schemes based on blockchain technology, achieving consensus poses a significant challenge. It is imperative to explore lightweight consensus mechanisms or alternatives like \"proof of X\" for such authentication methods. Requirement of randomness: Reports from security protocol developers and NIST requirements have emphasized the need for the creation of robust random and pseudo-random number generators. In contemporary security protocols, the absence of reliable random numbers poses a significant challenge. Consequently, there is a demand for the development of simpler yet effective random number generators. Another facet of future research involves integrating these random numbers into security algorithms and analyzing their impact on the behavior of existing security protocols. Authentication phase aspects: The survey provided a clear depiction of the infrequent use of authentication protocols with four to eight phases. Although these multi-phase structures were initially introduced with the aim of improving efficiency, they have encountered several drawbacks, which have hindered their adoption in the research domain. It is crucial to identify the underlying reasons for these challenges and to develop algorithms or functions that can help rejuvenate these phase structures. Moreover, it's important to acknowledge that an increased number of phases within a single operation, such as authentication, can potentially elevate complexity and resource consumption. This heightened complexity may, in turn, jeopardize the overall system's performance and lead to potential failures. Authentication type aspects: Both IoTs and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have incorporated generic and standard security protocols to deliver authentication services. Industrial IoT (IIoT) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have also adopted this approach and have even ventured into developing customized authentication methods tailored to their specific domains. However, as devices become increasingly sophisticated and resource-constrained, the demand for security protocols has shifted from generic solutions to lightweight and even ultra-lightweight alternatives. In the future, security protocol designers should prioritize the development of robust algorithms that offer both lightweight and ultra-lightweight features. This is essential to meet the evolving needs of these diverse IoT domains while ensuring the security and efficiency of their operations. Attack orientation: The survey conducted in this research work underscores the vulnerabilities of IoT systems to a range of security threats, including de-synchronization attacks, message modification attacks, cloning attacks, masquerading problems, node compromise issues, wormhole problems, and smart card vulnerabilities. Despite the recognition of these threats, research efforts to mitigate and address such attacks have not received substantial attention, leaving ample room for advancement in future research endeavors. Password problem: The global challenge of passwords affects the security of IoT systems, as the trade-off between usability and security continues to impact their effectiveness. One-time passwords (OTPs) also fall within this spectrum, introducing additional concerns related to phishing when combined with shared secret practices. Consequently, IoTs are in search of a comprehensive authentication system that can effectively address these multifaceted problems. Authentication requirements: Authentication protocols in IoT systems necessitate certain properties, namely backward secrecy and anonymity, to ensure robust authentication features. However, these two critical attributes have not received extensive research attention and require significant focus for enhancement. Furthermore, lightweight end-to-end authentication methods are highly favored in the context of IoT systems. Authentication overhead: Creating an authentication protocol might seem straightforward, but crafting an efficient one is a challenging endeavor. An efficient authentication protocol should not introduce unnecessary overhead by exchanging an excessive number of messages. In the context of IoTs, this challenge is exacerbated as the number of devices increases, causing a significant rise in message exchanges. Furthermore, the message size should be kept to a minimum. Therefore, authentication protocol designers must strike a balance by utilizing a limited number of messages with efficient size constraints to enhance the productivity of the authentication system. Post-quantum sustainability: The advancement of quantum computing poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of existing cryptosystems. To ensure the resilience of authentication protocols, designers must prioritize the development of quantum-resistant constructions for authentication keys or their derivatives. Privacy-awareness: Privacy is an integral component of security, and even an authenticated entity can potentially compromise the privacy of data. Consequently, researchers should focus on designing an authentication mechanism that can effectively safeguard privacy. Moreover, it's essential to consider the interdependencies of various privacy parameters when developing authentication solutions. Authorization integration: It is a common observation that legitimate users can be more susceptible to misusing the authorization process. Detecting such misuse can be challenging, especially when a user is authenticated but not properly authorized for a specific operation. Many authentication methods primarily focus on verifying the identity of nodes or users and often treat authorization as an assumed or separate module. Nevertheless, an optimal approach is to integrate an authentication mechanism that seamlessly incorporates authorization features, creating a coherent and unified process for both authentication and authorization. Scalability: In the literature, it's a common trend to find authentication schemes claiming to be scalable. However, these claims often fall short of validation in real-world scenarios. Hence, it becomes imperative to establish a clear and substantiated correlation between these authentication schemes and scalability, backed by valid proofs and evidence. Authentication as a service (AaaS): Authentication as a Service (AaaS) offers a range of authentication services, including multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and password management in the cloud. While cloud-based solutions provide these authentication services, they also inherit inherent security vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches. Therefore, there is a need to further develop efficient AaaS solutions that explicitly address and enhance cloud security. These aforementioned aspects of future research work play a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainable development of the IoT environment. They must be given significant attention to enhance the efficiency of IoT applications. Future researchers should actively consider these challenges and issues when working on IoT advancements, whether in the form of services or products. Achieving robust authentication in IoT applications is crucial for verifying the identity of devices and users, ensuring that only authorized entities can access the network, data, and services. Implementing effective authentication mechanisms in IoT applications requires careful consideration of the specific requirements and constraints of the IoT ecosystem, including device capabilities, network architecture, and the sensitivity of the data being protected. A layered approach, combining multiple authentication methods, often provides the best defense against unauthorized access, ensuring that IoT systems remain secure and trustworthy. In conclusion, this survey suggests some important technologies and methods for strengthening authentication in IoT ecosystems. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Certificates utilize a system of digital certificates, incorporating public and private keys, to authenticate devices securely within IoT environments. By verifying each other's trusted Certificate Authority (CA)-issued digital certificates, this system enables devices to mutually authenticate, facilitating secure communications. To further bolster security, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) demands two or more verification forms from different credential categories, such as knowledge (passwords), possession (security tokens or smart cards), and inherence (biometric verification like fingerprints or facial recognition). Additionally, OAuth and token-based authentication provide secure mechanisms for authorizing device access to services and resources without sharing passwords, using standards like OAuth for access delegation and tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens, JWT) for managing sessions and information transmission securely. In addition to these, two-step verification, which combines a password with another verification method like an SMS or app-generated code, adds an additional layer of security similar to MFA. For physical device security, Secure Elements (SEs) offer a tamper-resistant platform for securely hosting applications and their cryptographic data, enabling secure storage of digital keys and cryptographic operations on IoT devices. Similarly, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) provide a secure cryptoprocessor that can securely store cryptographic keys used for authentication, ensuring these keys remain protected outside the TPM's environment. Together, these technologies form a comprehensive framework for enhancing the authentication and security of devices within the IoT, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and other security threats. 5 Access control and data privacy models The IoT focuses primarily on facilitating the unbroken exchange of data across a variety of platforms. Security measures, including access control and data privacy, are managed at the local network level in IoT networks because these networks do not use standard architectures or protocols. Access control mechanisms are utilized in order to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the system's resources, which may include data, hardware, and software applications. These resources may include access to the system. Fig. 4 presents an overarching categorization of the various access control mechanisms. The administrator of the network has the ability to set a limit on the number of users who have access to the network resources and to keep a list of authorized users thanks to access control mechanisms that are discretionary in nature. The list is kept up-to-date over the course of some time, and access is granted according to the privileges that are currently available. Only administrators and managers will be able to access the resources when mandatory access control mechanisms are in place, because access will be denied to any other users. The operations can only be performed by a select group of users, despite the fact that this access control mechanism is the most secure one. These days, the most common type of access control mechanism, particularly in applications based on the IoT, is the role-based model. Users have access to the resources they need based on the roles they play in their organizations, making role-based access control a more flexible form of access control. There are a number of additional mechanisms that enable the modification of permissions in accordance with a predetermined set of rules, so rule-based access control mechanisms do not exist in a vacuum. There is a potential for data loss and disruption of service due to the inability of centralized access control mechanisms to scale to meet the demands of ever-growing IoT applications. In today's world, centralized mechanisms have taken on a significant role. The paper [78] describes the non-blockchain as a distributed access control mechanism that does not put its faith in centralized authorities having control over end users. Another research study [79] provides an illustration of one of these mechanisms by referring to organization-based distributed control access control. Blockchain technology offers individualized solutions to a variety of security challenges, including access control. Access to the resources is granted on the basis of the information contained in the response's header regarding the access control mechanism, which, in the case of policy-header-based access control, is where the authorization information is stored. As was covered in the chapter before this one, smart contracts are composed of coded sets of agreements that, once satisfied, grant access to the resources. Token-based access control involves providing authorized users with tokens that contain particular validation rules and time stamps. These tokens are unique to each user. At the time of access, the system verifies the token, and only users who have tokens that are still valid are granted permission to access the resources. Computing in the cloud is one of the key technologies that made it possible to build the IoT. The vast majority of the data generated by IoT applications is kept in the cloud, where user applications can connect to it in order to better serve the requirements of end users. The use of attribute-based signatures, also known as ABS schemes, can be beneficial for both controlling access and maintaining data privacy. The paper [58] reports that lightweight versions of these schemes are currently being developed for a wide variety of applications in order to accomplish the goals of unforgeability and anonymity. In certain applications, such as healthcare, it is absolutely necessary to validate the authenticity of the user. The data authenticators could be validated by using lightweight protocols that were deployed at the edges of the network in order to protect data privacy and prevent unauthorized access [80]. As a result of the fact that cloud services can be accessed through public networks like the internet, they are at risk of being subject to severe security breaches. Although the cloud offers blackbox security measures, it is possible that these safeguards are not suitable for all applications. Access control and privacy concerns for applications dealing with sensitive data, such as those dealing with healthcare and finances, have been addressed with the help of reputation-based mechanisms [81]. In an environment like this, trust plays a critical role, and the paper [82] proposes defining a set of parameters at various levels in order to perform periodic evaluations of the system. Internet applications make extensive use of systems known as public key infrastructure (PKI), which are designed to protect the confidentiality of both data and communications. On the other hand, resource-constrained IoT networks are unable to make use of them because the PKI necessitates intensive computing and memory requirements. A recently developed lightweight compact certificate was designed to be suitable for IoT applications [83]. The work [84] explains that novel key derivation procedures that make use of fuzzy logic extractors and lightweight encryption algorithms can be combined together to simplify access control mechanisms and make them suitable for resource-limited networks. Techniques like division computation over encrypted data with privacy provisioning have become increasingly popular to serve the access control and privacy needs of the IoT networks [80]. Access control in a blockchain environment can be implemented in a variety of different ways. The utilization of smart contracts enables the provision of mechanisms for role-based access control. These contracts are deployed on blockchain platforms and written in the Solidity programming language. Each transaction that takes place within the network triggers the execution of a smart contract, and access to the network is granted only to authentic users who have passed validation. Every user has a role that is assigned to them, and the permissions they have are determined by that role [85,86]. All of the relations are mapped to the internal data structures using the coded rules that are contained within the smart contracts. According to [87], blockchain networks naturally incorporate security features such as the provenance of data and the confidentiality of transactions. The introduction of blockchain technology and the increased level of security it provides have brought about revolutionary improvements in a variety of industrial applications. In order to improve safety while continuing to take advantage of the innovative solutions offered by the IoT, many IIoT applications are being converted into blockchain-based applications [88]. Sharing electronic healthcare records, also known as EHRs, is one of the most significant challenges facing healthcare platforms [89]. Motes, which have a slow computational speed and a limited amount of memory, are used in body area networks (BANs). They are utilized to collect vital signs from the patient's body and convey this information to the central authorities in charge of the operation. According to the paper [90], the use of specialized verification schemes and digital signatures is a viable option for achieving both access control and data security. For IoT networks with limited resources, it is possible to implement security mechanisms such as the outsourced calculation of rational numbers that protect users’ privacy and allow for secure data sharing and access. Utilizing these strategies could prevent data from becoming accessible to unauthorized users [58]. According to [91], there are a large number of decentralized algorithms and other blockchain mechanisms that can be customized to fit the needs of IoT applications while maintaining the same level of data privacy and security. Table 8 provides a summary of some significant contributions made to the access control and privacy aspects of blockchain technology and the IoT. 5.1 Open research issues in access control Access control has a rich history of research and development, with several access control models having been effectively implemented in real-world applications. However, as IoT technologies continue to evolve, different information resources are becoming deeply integrated for extensive use. The distinctive characteristics of IoT systems, including node heterogeneity, open environments, and the sharing of resources among multiple parties, introduce new requirements for access control models and mechanisms. Despite these challenges, many research endeavors have concentrated on introducing innovative models and mechanisms that enable fine-grained access control in IoT systems and their associated resources. Nevertheless, there remain numerous important issues and challenges that demand further attention and resolution. Policy Conflict Caused by Different Authorizations: In this article, various access control models designed for IoT environments were introduced, including RBAC and ABAC. Several proposals related to RBAC have centered on integrating interpersonal relationships into access decision-making processes. However, these proposals frequently ignore the characteristics of multiparty resource sharing and assume that resources belong to a single entity. Conversely, numerous ABAC-related proposals have employed a straightforward approach to tackle this situation, requiring access to be authorized only when all users grant approval. Yet, this strategy can be overly restrictive for real-world applications, as it may limit resource availability. To address these challenges, more extensive efforts are necessary to concentrate on resolving policy conflicts arising from diverse authorizations. Such efforts can significantly enhance the automation of policy composition and conflict resolution, making access control in the IoT more adaptable and practical for real-world applications. Policy Conflict Caused by Multiparty Relationships: The challenge of policy conflicts arises due to the distinctive characteristics of the IoT search environment. When integrating multiparty access control policies, the policies of different agents often include numerous constraints. For a given resource, different owners may impose varying constraints on its access. As a result, several access control decisions may emerge, each aligning with the requirements of individual users. However, these decisions can sometimes be mutually exclusive. The amalgamation of these constraints frequently leads to inconsistencies and conflicts. Hence, finding efficient and dynamic methods to swiftly select and adjust access control decisions for diverse users is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. Attribute-Permission Assignment Within Noise Data:IoT search operates within a multidomain collaborative environment where different access control policies are utilized in distinct domains. To establish unified policy management, it is often necessary to convert other access control models into the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. ABAC relies on attributes as its core components, and access control decisions are based on the set of attributes that the requester possesses. This characteristic makes ABAC particularly well-suited for the IoT search environment, as it effectively segregates policy management from access control decision-making. The process of converting other policy types into ABAC entails creating high-quality attribute-permission correspondences, primarily based on role-permission and user-permission relationships. Notably, original user-permission relations may contain noise data, significantly impacting the accuracy of policy generation and introducing substantial security risks to access control systems. Addressing the assignment of attribute-permission relationships within noisy data represents a substantial research challenge in the realm of access control for IoT search. Modeling and Evaluation of IoT Security Search: It is imperative to maintain a balance between quality, security, and efficiency throughout the process of IoT search. The escalating growth of IoT has brought increased focus to its security. Over the past decades, modeling and simulation (MS) techniques have effectively addressed various complex security challenges. Given that IoT possesses a distinctive address and relies on standard communication protocols, MS methods and tools are well-suited for addressing IoT-related issues. Despite this, there has been limited exploration into the modeling and evaluation of IoT security searches. Authentication and Anonymous Protection of Physical Devices in the IoT: Within industrial control security IoT, numerous authentication methods are developed to facilitate real-time communication between the cloud platform and sensing devices. However, often, these methods face a challenge in simultaneously ensuring both efficiency and security. Consequently, there is a need for increased emphasis on the technology related to device authentication and anonymity protection. This emphasis is crucial to guaranteeing the trustworthiness of data sources, preserving privacy, and maintaining data availability. 6 Scalability models Scalability is the primary issue that arises with IoT networks. In order to keep the system in a state of equilibrium, the network will need to modify itself to accommodate the growing number of nodes and the volume of traffic. When connected to blockchain networks, IoT devices bring an exponential increase in the severity of this problem. Because each transaction needs to be validated before it is added to the block and then stored at every node in the network, blockchains are unable to accommodate the growing number of transactions generated by the IoT. According to the paper [98] some ineffective ways of increasing scalability include increasing the block size and reducing the amount of time spent on the consensus protocol. Researchers from all over the world have come up with a variety of solutions to address the scalability issues, and this section will discuss a few of those solutions. LPWAN, which stands for low-power wide area networks, is one of the technologies that made it possible for the Internet to exist. Scalability is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to meet the demanding requirements of an increasing number of applications for the IoT. According to the paper [70], increasing scalability can be accomplished through the seamless integration of polynomial-based optimization techniques into these networks. Some of the obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve scalability include interoperability, deployability, and the absence of standard communication protocols. The scalability of the system can be improved to some degree [99] by making it possible for edge devices to conform to the modular properties of the applications. Scalability in the IoT can be attributed, in large part, to the fact that the majority of its applications are geared toward centralized cloud servers. The authors in [100] found that, as a consequence of this, blockchain-based decentralized applications exhibited superior scalability. Altering the data structures already present within the blockchain to better suit the needs of the application is yet another method for increasing the system's capacity to scale. The corresponding algorithms are developed in order to gain access to and process these structures, thereby reducing the amount of time necessary for the processing of the blocks contained within the blockchain. The paper [101] explains that the scalability of transactions can be improved in this way. As IoT devices are incapable of executing complex consensus algorithms, direct integration of blockchain and IoT is not possible. Instead, a local loop network can serve as an interface between these two networks to facilitate communication. The authors in [102] found that the transaction rate could be increased by relieving blockchain of the additional burden of processing data from IoT devices. According to the paper \"cite\" tang2022coordinate, techniques like source look-up techniques and discovery techniques can reduce the communication overhead. Security from beginning to end and scalable data sensing mechanisms are prerequisites for systems that have more stringent requirements for the collection of data, the flow of data from one entity to another, and the storage of data. According to the paper [103], a more effective strategy for accomplishing the goal of achieving the required level of scalability is to design infrastructures that are capable of being configured in order to collect and exchange data. According to the paper [104], algorithms that cut down on the amount of time needed for validation and consensus processes also make valuable contributions to improving scalability. In addition, scalability can be improved by utilizing scheduling and synchronization mechanisms [105]. These mechanisms give users greater access while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of collisions. According to the paper [106], the quality of the services that are offered to final users can be adjusted to better meet their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Access control is vital for securing the vast network of devices in the IoT. In conclusion, this survey suggests some key technologies used to achieve robust access control in the IoT. Authentication serves as the critical layer that determines the identity of a user or device attempting to access a resource, employing mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, and digital certificates to ensure security. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are utilized to define specific rules that either permit or restrict access to resources for particular users or devices; for instance, an ACL might enable a user to view but not modify sensor data. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) takes a different approach by assigning permissions according to predefined roles, meaning a \"maintenance technician\" might have the authority to reboot devices but not to change their configurations. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) provides an even finer level of control by evaluating attributes like location, time, or device type, potentially restricting thermostat access to authorized devices within the office network during work hours. The management of access control has traditionally been centralized, relying on a central server; however, distributed models offer an alternative by allowing devices to independently make access decisions based on established rules, thereby diminishing the dependency on a central authority and enhancing system resilience. 7 Conclusion and future directions In this paper, the methods that are currently available in the literature are discussed, and this paper also presents the methods that are currently available. The subsequent step is an in-depth discussion of the numerous security risks and the importance of threat modeling. The subsequent topic is a discussion of the various IoT applications’ necessary security precautions. It reviews the prior research on the numerous security issues and the solutions put forth by various researchers. The holes that were found while conducting this literature review served as inspiration for the current research work. 7.1 Research challenges The billions of IoT devices deployed across the globe collect personal and sensitive data and exchange it with other networks using intelligent interfaces. Providing device authentication, authorization, data privacy, and security in such an un trusted environment is a challenge. Centralized trusted infrastructure cannot scale to the dynamic and ever intensifying traffic and, thus, leading to bottlenecks in the network. Distributed authentication can scale to the increasing demands of the IoT networks, but requires distributed trusted systems. The majority of the work in the IoT security domain focuses on embracing the security mechanisms of WSNs and conventional Internet-based applications. However, these mechanisms are far from being implemented in real-time scenarios due to the specific challenges of IoT, such as Scalability With the number of IoT devices installed surpassing the total world human population, designing scalable architectures that cater to the demanding needs of the broad spectrum of IoT applications is the need of the hour. Device Heterogeneity The IoT nodes operate on different hardware and operating system platforms and use different sets of protocols for communication and other purposes. The quality of service (QoS) requirements are also different for different services, or for the same set of services, there may be different modes of operation. Interoperability, which allows a device to communicate and exchange information with other devices across various networks, emerges from the challenges posed by heterogeneity and the absence of standardized protocols and architectures within IoT networks. In the early stages of research focused on IoT security, a thorough literature review highlighted several notable deficiencies in current state-of-the-art approaches. Among these are the need for a lightweight mechanism that can facilitate secure communication and data sharing in IoT networks constrained by limited resources. Additionally, there is a crucial demand for improved access control and data privacy measures to protect sensitive information. Furthermore, the development of user and IoT device authentication methods is essential for establishing a trusted operating environment, underscoring the gaps that future research must address to enhance IoT security. Resource Limited By design, most the IoT devices have low memory and low computational processing ability. They operate on battery power in harsh environments. The distributed nature of the resources The resources in the IoT network are distributed to provide different functionalities, cooperation, and data classification based on applications. 7.2 Future directions The integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, and blockchain into IoT ecosystems significantly enhances their security. Each of these technologies addresses specific vulnerabilities and brings unique strengths to the security architecture of IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in IoT security, offering capabilities such as anomaly detection, adaptive threat response, and automated security. ML algorithms excel at processing extensive datasets generated by IoT devices, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies, which are crucial for early breach detection and intervention. Over time, ML can adapt to new threats dynamically, offering superior threat detection and response compared to static measures. Moreover, ML automation reduces manual oversight, enhancing security efficiency and response speed. Fog computing, operating closer to data sources, reduces latency in threat detection and response, mitigating risks faster. By processing data locally, fog computing minimizes the attack surface and follows a decentralized security model, enhancing resilience against attacks. Edge computing further strengthens IoT security by processing data at the source, reducing data transit risks, and enabling real-time security actions. It optimizes resources by empowering devices to autonomously analyze data, enhancing privacy and security. Blockchain technology reinforces security and trust within IoT ecosystems through its secure, immutable ledger, resistant to tampering and fraud. Its decentralized approach mitigates single points of failure, enhancing network resilience while enabling secure, transparent transactions between devices, essential for secure machine-to-machine interactions.

Therefore, understanding the highly non-stational and complex impact of traffic factors on air quality is very important for building air quality prediction models. Using real-world air pollutant data from Taipei City, this study integrates diverse factors, including traffic flow, speed, rainfall patterns, and meteorological factors. We constructed a Bayesian network probability model based on rainfall events as a big data analysis framework to investigate understand traffic factor causality relationships and condition probabilities for meteorological factors and air pollutant concentrations. Generalized Additive Model (GAM) verified non-linear relationships between traffic factors and air pollutants. Consequently, we propose a long short term memory (LSTM) model to predict airborne pollutant concentrations. This study propose a new approach of air pollutants and meteorological variable analysis procedure by considering both rainfall amount and patterns.\\n                  Results indicate improved air quality when controlling vehicle speed above 40 km/h and maintaining an average vehicle flow < 1200 vehicles per hour. This study also classified rainfall events into four types depending on its characteristic. Wet deposition from varied rainfall types significantly affects air quality, with TypeⅠrainfall events (long-duration heavy rain) having the most pronounced impact. An LSTM model incorporating GAM and Bayesian network outcomes yields excellent performance, achieving correlation R\\n                     2 > 0.9 and 0.8 for first and second order air pollutants, i.e., CO, NO, NO2, and NOx; and O3, PM10, and PM2.5, respectively.\\n               ', 'openaccess': '0', 'openaccessArticle': False, 'openaccessType': None, 'openArchiveArticle': False, 'openaccessSponsorName': None, 'openaccessSponsorType': None, 'openaccessUserLicense': None, 'dcterms:subject': [{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Air quality'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rainfall pattern'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Traffic emissions'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Generalized additive model'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bayesian networks'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'LSTM model'}], 'link': [{'@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001074224000548', '@rel': 'self', '@_fa': 'true'}, {'@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074224000548', '@rel': 'scidir', '@_fa': 'true'}]}, 'scopus-id': '85192867679', 'scopus-eid': '2-s2.0-85192867679', 'link': {'@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85192867679', '@rel': 'abstract'}, 'originalText': {'xocs:doc': {'xocs:meta': {'xocs:open-access': {'xocs:oa-article-status': {'@is-open-access': '0', '@is-open-archive': '0'}}, 'xocs:available-online-date': {'@yyyymmdd': '20240214', '$': '2024-02-14'}}}}}\n"

Table 2 IoT Attacks in Perceptual layer Security. Table 2 Issue Description Node Tempering In the event that an adversary is able to obtain physical access to sensor nodes, they will be able to replace the hardware or connect directly in order to either gain access or alter sensitive information [14]. It's possible that the sensitive information includes encryption keys or routing table routes. Fake Node Hackers can inject malicious data into IoT systems by creating a fake node, causing low-power devices to consume energy [31]. It also attacks as a man in the middle. Side Channel Attack Attackers exploit power, time, and electromagnetic radiation from sensor nodes to breach encryption [31]. Physical attack IoT devices can be physically damaged by attackers for denial of service (DoS) attacks, especially in open and closed environments. Code injection malice An adversary gains illegal access to a system by physically compromising a node and inserting malicious code [32]. Sensor Data Security Sensor data confidentiality is relatively low since adversaries can readily intercept the data. However, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of this data is of paramount importance. Mass-Node authentication Authentication problems are prevalent among numerous nodes within an IoT system [33]. The substantial volume of network communication required for authentication procedures can have adverse effects on system performance. Table 3 IoT Attacks in Network layer security. Table 3 Issue Description Heterogeneity problem The IoT perceptual layer encompasses a diverse range of technologies. Within this layer, the access network accommodates multiple access methods, creating a significant challenge in ensuring both security and interoperability [34]. Network Congestion Network congestion can result from various factors, such as the substantial volume of sensor data and the communication overhead generated by numerous devices authenticating themselves, among other reasons [34]. This issue could potentially be addressed through the implementation of a practical device authentication mechanism and the utilization of efficient transport protocols. RFIDs Interference This type of attack, which targets the network layer, entails disrupting the radio frequency signals employed by RFIDs by introducing noise signals, ultimately leading to a denial of service [35]. Jamming This type of attack bears similarities to radio frequency interference, as previously discussed in the context of RFIDs. In this attack, the malicious actor interferes with the radio frequency used by wireless sensor networks to disrupt their ability to offer services [36]. It represents another variation of a denial-of-service attack. Sniffing Attack This activity is commonly referred to as \"sniffing\" and involves the interception of wireless traffic in the vicinity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), RFIDs, or Bluetooth devices. Since the device layer in IoT primarily relies on wireless communication, attackers often initiate their attacks by first gathering information through the process of sniffing. Various specialized tools, such as packet sniffers, are employed for this purpose [37]. RFID Spoofing In this attack, the intruder gains unauthorized access to the system by mimicking RFID signals and reading the RFID tag. Subsequently, they transmit counterfeit data while using the original RFID tag [4] Route attacks Attackers can alter routing information and distribute it in the network, causing loops, false routes, error messages, or traffic drop [38]. Sybil Attack In Sybil attack, a single malicious node impersonates multiple nodes. This node can cause harm by distributing false routing information or disrupting the WSN election process [38]. Table 4 IoT Attacks in Support layer Security. Table 4 Issue Description Data Security Maintaining data confidentiality and security in the cloud requires protection from breaches. This can be achieved through tools for detecting cloud data migration, preventing data loss, and monitoring file and database activity. Cloud data security can be achieved through data dispersion and fragmentation [9]. Portability, Interoperability Interoperability and portability among cloud vendors are major issues today. Cloud migration can be challenging due to proprietary standards used by different vendors. This heterogeneity increases security risks [9]. Recovery and Continuity Cloud vendors must maintain services during natural disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes. Business continuity clouds should be located in a location that is least affected by disasters. It should follow the quick response team approach. Clouds should have data backup plans [9]. Audit Cloud The Cloud Security Alliance establishes standards for cloud vendors, requiring ongoing audits to ensure compliance and build user trust. Tenant Safety It is possible for several users’ data to be kept on the same physical drive in the cloud or for data to be shared by tenants, who are users of IaaS. An adversary could steal tenant data due to the shared physical media. Virtual Security Virtualization processes can differ from provider to provider of cloud services. It is important to ensure that virtualization is secure. Some virtual machine communication may circumvent network security controls [9]. For there to be no problems with cloud auditing, virtual machine migration needs to be secure. Table 5 IoT Attacks in Application layer Security. Table 5 Issue Description Data Authentication and Access In applications with multiple users possessing different access privileges, it is essential to implement authentication and access control measures at the application layer [39]. Phishing attack Adversaries employ infected emails or web links to illicitly obtain valid user credentials, thereby gaining unauthorized access [40]. Malicious Active X Scripts An adversary has the capability to compromise the system by transmitting an Active X script to the IoT user over the internet, prompting the user to execute it [5]. Malware attack Attackers can employ malware to pilfer data or disrupt applications through denial of service. Adversaries utilize threats like Trojan horses, worms, and viruses as means to exploit vulnerable systems [5]. Table 6 Comparison of different Vulnerabilities and Threads in IoT.

Key Findings Advantages Disadvantages [71] The study suggests a mutual authentication and session key generation strategy for IoT applications. The present study addresses IoT system issues such high computation and communication costs, lack of access level determination, and smart card theft susceptibility. The scalability of the proposed solution with regard to managing a substantial quantity of IoT devices and services is not addressed in the study. [72] The suggested method zones the network and connects nodes using two keys inside and between zones. The lightweight authentication operation for intra-zone communication reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency The research does not discuss how network size, node density, or dynamics may affect approach performance and security. [73] The proposed method includes an authentication protocol to authenticate cluster heads before sending information, preventing malicious nodes in the network Provides a regular structure for the transfer of information within the cluster and keys to secure the information exchanged in subsequent communications The author does not Extend the proposed security method to other networks, including mobile networks. [60] The scheme utilizes temporary identities generated by the central server using a master key during the device registration process. The paper introduces the concept of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and highlights their advantage in generating unpredictable outputs, which can contribute to the overall security of the scheme The analysis of attack scenarios in the paper is limited to an informal discussion and does not include a formal security analysis or experimental validation [74] The smart cabin lighting system is designed with four features: automatic control of lighting devices around people, touch keypad control, app control, and data collection for analysis Offers a cost-effective and energy-efficient ship cabin smart lighting system design. Potential privacy concerns or considerations pertaining to the accumulation and analysis of data from the smart lighting system are not addressed in the paper. [75] The paper proposes a lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol for IoT-based smart healthcare systems, addressing the security concerns associated with IoT devices in healthcare. Addresses the security concerns associated with IoT devices in healthcare, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of patient data The research makes no mention of real-world implementation or validation of the recommended methodology in an actual smart healthcare system, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings. [76] The paper discusses the impact of embedding watermarks on recognition accuracy in iris biometric authentication and highlights the need for comparative evaluations between watermarked and watermark-free systems The proposed approach of embedding iris biometric watermarking offers high security, resistance to attacks, and non-intrusiveness, enhancing the overall security and robustness of authentication systems The technology and methodology utilized to integrate iris biometric watermarking are not examined in the study. [77] This paper proposes a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) that generates and maintains healthcare certificates using blockchain technology. For security, the distributed application integrates blockchain with IoT-based medical devices. It also secures by specifying smart contract rules. The technology and methodology utilized to integrate is highly computational overhead are not examined in the study. Table 8 Summary of researches in the area of access control and data privacy. Table 8 Ref. Contributions Advantages Limitations [92] Access control solutions in a cloud computing environment are categorized by authors using various classifications. Furthermore, they provided a performance evaluation of various access control models. It examine the relationships between models and technologies, application scenarios, and pros and cons. It also discuss emerging access control issues and cloud computing research directions. The authors only dealt with the access control model as a standard. They didn't deal with the stages and nature of access control. [93] The authors suggested several access control categories, one of which is related to blockchain technology, notably smart contracts and transactions. Furthermore, they specified the precise application domain and blockchain platform used for each project. It is an in depth discussion of blockchain taxonomy, application/use-cases, consensus mechanisms, prospective research, future directions, and related technologies. It also discusses the pros, cons, and opportunities of blockchain technology with IoT security. The authors ignored access control criteria such as access control models, stages, and natures. Furthermore, the blockchain platform, hardware, and performance parameters are included in the implementation criteria. [94] The authors presented a classification system for authentication using blockchain technology: Access management based on smart contracts and on transactions. This article explains IoT security and privacy with block chain. It also discussed how blockchain technology can improve IoT applications by providing security solutions. The survey did not contain the comparison criteria for access control, as well as general factors like implementation and evaluation. [95] This literature review covers blockchain-based IoT access control, VANET, healthcare, and supply chain network privacy and security methods. It evaluates methods for scalability, privacy, extensibility, accuracy, storage overhead, and computation overhead. The authors failed to differentiate between blockchain technology requirements and access control criteria. [96] The authors presented a classification scheme for authentication that makes use of blockchain. Both transaction-based and smart-contract-based access controls are included in this classification system. This paper covers device security, data collection and sharing, and industrial application. It also examine IIoT blockchain platform technical requirements. The comparison was based solely on two criteria: implementation and security levels. [97] In order to implement access control in IoT systems utilizing blockchain technology, the authors defined particular characteristics of access control.

With the help of the IoT, physical objects can be given the ability to generate, receive, and seamlessly trade data with one another. The IoT includes a wide variety of applications, each of which focuses on automating a specific task and works to give inanimate objects the ability to act independently of human intervention. The currently available and upcoming IoT applications hold a great deal of promise for enhancing the level of convenience, productivity, and automation enjoyed by users. High levels of security, privacy, authentication, and the ability to recover from attacks are required for the implementation of such a world in a manner that is constantly expanding. In this light, it is necessary to make the necessary adjustments to the architecture of IoT applications to accomplish end-to-end security in IoT environments. In this article, a comprehensive review of the security-related challenges and potential sources of danger posed by IoT applications is provided. Following a discussion of security concerns, a variety of new and established technologies that are focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the applications of the IoT are covered. Machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, and blockchain are just a few of the technologies that help the IoT provide greater security. Keywords Internet of Things Blockchain Scalability Data Security Edge computing Authentication schemes 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the disruptive technologies of the 21st century that has revolutionized every business dimension across the globe. The Internet has become an essential component in daily activities such as e-commerce, e-learning, e-conferences, etc. According to [1], the number of IoT devices deployed may exceed 21.3 billion by 2022. Intelligent interfaces connect IoT devices in order to collaborate, gather, communicate, and store data. Deploying IoT devices enhances business productivity by optimizing operational procedures and maximizing the utilization of available resources. IoT brings innovation in the way things are monitored and managed remotely with the help of real-time data acquired from the sensors. With the unrestrained volumes of data generated by billions of connected devices, storage, management, and security are arduous. Security aspects such as authentication, authorization, privacy, confidentiality, availability, and integrity form the basis for information exchange in a trusted environment. Authentication is the process of identifying the genuineness of an entity. The authorization process allows only authenticated users to access the resources. The protection of privacy prevents hackers from accessing the user's private information. Data confidentiality is an outcome of authentication and authorization. It prevents sensitive data from being reclaimed and exploited. A device's availability confirms that IoT devices and services are resilient to attacks and are accessible all the time. Data integrity is the process of providing a tamper-proof platform for information communication, exchange, and storage. 1.1 Motivation The IoT needs to gain users’ trust before it can be widely used in business. To earn the trust of its users, the IoT must guarantee the users’ complete privacy and security. There is a very limited amount of published work that examines the security of the IoT, despite the fact that it is a very active research topic. On the other hand, the work is not current. Due to the fact that new threats in the IoT are discovered on a regular basis, we felt the need to conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of IoT security in order to provide researchers with direction regarding the efforts that are required in particular security areas. There is no discussion of support layer security in the IoT in any of the reviews that are currently available. Through the identification and discussion of a large number of support layer security issues in our paper, we were able to close the gap. The authentication and control of access are significant security challenges in the IoT, and a lot of work has been done in this area. We present an analysis of the most recent authentication and access control mechanisms in the IoT. 1.2 Contribution Among all the applications of the IoT, healthcare applications are the most important. The IoT has played a vital role in the sharing of various medical resources, making it an essential factor in the field of medicine. Today, information is shared freely across different networks, making it easy for practitioners and institutions to work with the available resources and deliver on the medical needs of society. However, recent advancements in technology have developed smart and intelligent IoT devices connected to the Internet that continuously transmit data. So providing security and privacy to this data in IoT is a very challenging task, which is to be considered the highest priority for several current and future applications of IoT. Security schemes in the IoT provide unauthorized access to information or other objects by protecting against alterations or destruction. Privacy schemes maintain the right to control the collected information for its usage and purpose. In this paper, we have surveyed major challenges such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability for IoT, briefly concerning remote health monitoring applications. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of existing access control solutions for IoT that addresses the above issues in existing survey papers. Our goal is to identify open challenges in existing authorization and access control solutions to drive the research and development of more effective access control solutions for IoT. The main contributions to our survey are the following: • Developing a Framework for Systematic and Comparative Analysis of Authorization, Access Control, and Scalability Solutions for IoT: This framework comprises a set of prerequisites that IoT authorization solutions should fulfill, along with defined criteria for their evaluation. • A review of several recent authorization frameworks for IoT and their evaluation with respect to the requirements and criteria in the framework. • Creating Guidelines for the Design of an Access Control Framework Tailored to the Specific Requirements and Constraints of prevalent IoT Applications. • There are currently unresolved difficulties in authenticating IoT devices and implementing scalable access control solutions. 1.3 Survey method In order to conduct our survey, we begin by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the key features of IoT systems and the technologies that support them. This analysis is based on an extensive review of existing literature and the latest advancements in the field of IoT. Our analysis has shown that cloud computing and edge computing are commonly utilized as fundamental technologies in the IoT to streamline the administration of devices and resources within IoT ecosystems. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the ways in which these computing paradigms have been modified for the IoT. Through the analysis of practical situations, we ascertain a collection of non-functional prerequisites for IoT systems. Based on these outlined requirements, we distill specific criteria that authorization solutions for IoT must meet. These criteria encompass essential tasks within the access control process, spanning policy definition, administration, assessment, and implementation. To gauge the alignment of existing authorization frameworks with these identified requirements, we scrutinize the features of the IoT ecosystems in which these frameworks operate. This examination involves a thorough analysis of IoT architecture styles, communication protocols, and data formats to grasp the inherent assumptions of the IoT environment. Particular attention is given to understanding the capabilities of nodes and their interconnections. Additionally, we delve into the characteristics of proposed authorization frameworks, encompassing the access control model, policy evaluation strategy, and deployment configuration. In our critical assessment, we evaluate multiple contemporary authorization frameworks tailored for the IoT against the specified requirements and criteria. We also gauged the suitability of these solutions for typical IoT applications. Our literature review has yielded valuable insights, guiding us in identifying significant trends and pointing towards emerging research avenues in the realm of access control for the IoT. Notably, our observations highlight a rising interest in crafting authorization frameworks explicitly designed for IoT systems. However, it is evident that many proposed frameworks aim to provide a one-size-fits-all solution to address authorization challenges in the IoT landscape. Our analysis underscores that diverse IoT applications exhibit unique requirements, emphasizing the absence of a universal solution capable of accommodating all scenarios. Therefore, the development of an IoT-tailored authorization framework should meticulously consider the distinctive requirements and limitations inherent to the specific IoT application under consideration. The subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an introductory explanation of IoT. In Section 3, a summary of the technology that makes IoT possible follows this with respect to provide security. In Section 4, we analyze the fundamental functional and non-functional prerequisites for IoT systems authentication and contributions made in authentication systems in the literature. Finally, the Section 4 concluded with open research issues related to IoT device authentication. In Section 5, we outline the primary criteria that IoT access control and privacy frameworks must meet, and in Section 6, we assess the frameworks with respect to scalability issues and existing solutions with research gaps. We then provide a conclusion to the paper at Section 70, by highlighting unresolved matters and propose areas for future research. 2 Technology behind IoT IoT is not a single technology but a blend of multiple technologies. Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) are the four technologies on which the IoT technology is based on big data analytics, cloud computing, and embedded systems, which are the technologies that enable building IoT applications. M2M technology, also known as the Internet of Devices, is used to capture events using a network connection and forward them to a central server. This server translates these events into meaningful information and uses it according to the specific applications. RFID, also known as the Internet of Objects, is a technology that uses simple, low-cost contactless disposable cards to store numbers and other attributes. These chips contain antennas, and using RFID readers, this data can be retrieved. WSN, also known as the Internet of Transducers, is used for sensing and collecting data from the environment where the devices are installed and then forwarding the acquired data to the central authorities. Computer systems monitor and regulate processes in industrial control systems using SCADA technology. SCADA uses Human Machine Interfaces (HCI), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), and Distributed Control Systems (DCS) to achieve this task. With billions of devices installed across the globe, enormous amounts of data are generated. Storing and managing such a large volume of data is a tedious process. \"Big data\" is a technology that is designed to store, analyze, and manage large volumes and varieties of data that arrive at different velocities. Cloud computing is an emerging technology that provides applications and services to its users over the Internet. It provides resources for computing, networking, and storing resources on-demand as a metered service. Different services offered on the cloud computing platform include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Embedded systems are smaller, hardware-based systems that are used to control larger systems. They use modules such as microprocessors/microcontrollers, memory modules, networking, digital signal processing, and graphical processors to accomplish different application-specific functions. Commercial-of-The-Shelf (COTS) modules are also used in some high-end applications where real-time processes are modeled with maximum precision and high operational accuracy. Network processors and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are also used in some domain-specific IoT applications. 2.1 IoT layered architecture Numerous authors and researchers have proposed diverse IoT architectures, with a common focus on a three-layer architecture [2]. Typically, the fundamental structure of IoT can be categorized into three primary layers: the application layer, the network layer, and the perception layer, as illustrated in the Fig. 1 [2]. The research community acknowledges that [3] is the most recent and widely used IoT architecture, which starts with the presentation of the three-layered structure. Subsequently, we delve into an exploration of additional layers that extend this architecture into a five-layered model. Perception layer: Within this layer, diverse devices establish connections, encompassing physical devices like sensors, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Bluetooth, as well as virtual devices such as barcodes, Quick Response (QR) codes, and Global Positioning System (GPS). This layer's primary function involves the aggregation of data from end nodes and its subsequent transmission to the network layer. These devices within this layer are typically acknowledged as resource-constrained. Network layer: This layer is responsible for gathering data transmitted by the end nodes of the perception layer and facilitating its transfer to the application layer. Its core duty lies in establishing connectivity with the devices integrated into the perception layer, employing various technologies such as 4 G and Wi-Fi. Additionally, it ensures the security of information received from the perception layer by implementing robust security mechanisms to safeguard against potential attacks. Application layer: Within this layer, end-users engage with applications tailored to their specific requirements. Services are provided in accordance with the users’ needs, allowing them to interact with technology based on the functionalities of the end nodes. In addition to the foundational 3-layer architecture, we also observe the emergence of intermediate architectures, culminating in a 5-layered IoT architecture as detailed in the reference [3]. These additional layers focus on data processing originating from the perception layer and on aspects of system management. The transition is illustrated in Fig. 1, depicting a sequence of critical elements in IoT architectural designs: identification, sensing, communication, computation, services, and semantics. It is evident that the initial step in IoT processes is device identification. Consequently, authenticating and verifying the devices within the perception layer hold significant importance in IoT applications. 2.2 IoT applications The IoT enables machine-to-machine, human-to-human, and machine-to-human communication. Recent advancements in IoT systems have had a favorable influence on individuals’ daily activities, ranging from information access to real-time service delivery. The IoT has altered how humans interact with technology, with far-reaching implications for daily living, industry, and society as a whole. Its importance rests in a number of crucial areas, including ubiquitous computing, smart automation, remote applications, and so on. The potential of the IoT to integrate smoothly into daily life, automate and improve decision-making processes, deliver customized experiences, and open up new avenues for innovation and sustainability is the primary reason for the relevance of the IoT in human engagement with technology. As IoT technology continues to advance, it is anticipated that its influence on human engagement with technology will become more profound. This highlights the significance of tackling the issues that accompany it in order to fully achieve the potential benefits that it offers. IoT connects objects to the internet and to one another, allowing for hitherto inconceivable levels of interaction and data sharing. This pervasive connectivity enables seamless integration of technology into daily things, making human-technology interaction more intuitive and natural. IoT creates new chances for creative services and business models. For example, the capacity to monitor items in real-time leads to models such as \"Product as a Service,\" in which firms charge based on consumption rather than selling the product itself. This transformation can result in more sustainable consumption patterns and new revenue sources for businesses. IoT devices are critical for environmental monitoring, including tracking pollution levels, water quality, and wildlife migrations. This information can help guide conservation activities and policies aimed at ensuring sustainability. Furthermore, IoT can improve resource utilization in enterprises and residences, thereby increasing energy efficiency and reducing waste. The IoT is a technology that allows inanimate objects to act autonomously in order to improve efficiency, convenience, and quality of life. By integrating sensors, software, and other technologies, IoT enables these objects to gather and exchange data and perform tasks without human input. The technology also provides comprehensive environmental data collection and analysis for better decision-making. In agriculture, for example, IoT sensors can measure soil moisture, ambient temperature, and plant health to optimize watering and fertilization programs for greater resource efficiency and crop yields. IoT-capable machines can monitor their own operating state and anticipate potential issues, scheduling maintenance at optimal times to reduce downtime and extend equipment lifespan. IoT solutions can also automatically respond to risks and inconsistencies, improving safety and security. Security frameworks powered by the IoT can instantly alert authorities or take pre-set actions to address hazards. IoT devices can automate tedious and time-consuming tasks, improving quality of life. Automated home systems, voice-activated controls, and emergency alerting systems powered by IoT give elderly and disabled individuals more independence. Additionally, IoT can customize device functionalities to match user habits and preferences, providing a more personalized experience across entertainment, healthcare, and commerce. The IoT can be utilized in many different aspects of life, both in the private and public sectors. With IoT, people can track lost pets, monitor their house's security system, and keep track of appliance maintenance schedules. Consumers can use IoT to make restaurant reservations, monitor their exercise progress and overall health, and receive coupons for stores they pass by. Businesses can use IoT to monitor supply chains, track customer spending habits, collect feedback, maintain inventory levels, and engage in predictive maintenance of their machines and devices. The IoT is also helpful in IT service management, which is an essential detail since IT departments are called upon to do more in a digital world with more reliance on wireless networks. Blockchain, a more efficient and secure method of transaction and data processing, is also a natural beneficiary of IoT technology. Thus, we can expect to see IoT and Blockchain working together more frequently in the future. The digitalization of things has drastically increased over the past few years and has been made possible through cheap resources that are now available to everyone. IoT grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the rising penetration of smart analytics and remote monitoring. There has also been a strong shift over the last decade from non-IoT devices to IoT devices. In fact, it is expected that 75% of all devices will be IoT by 2030. The IoT has been smoothly integrated into many aspects of our globalized economy and way of life, from interconnected consumer products such as appliances, security systems, and automobiles to big manufacturing applications such as those in agribusiness and power. As the number of connected devices grows, businesses must find the most effective ways of ensuring cybersecurity in a technology-driven world. 2.3 Need for security in IoT The security of traditional systems remains a pervasive concern, with the ongoing reliance on traditional frameworks for development lacking specific standards. Technologies that continue to rely on these frameworks are particularly vulnerable to security threats. As the IoT market expands, safeguarding company data and intellectual property becomes increasingly critical. Ensuring the security of IoT devices requires developers to adhere to the following key services:. Authentication: The upcoming challenge for IoT revolves around authenticating IoT users, a task that has become more intricate with the introduction of new standards and self-configuring protocols, in contrast to the relatively simpler traditional approaches. Utilizing two-factor authentication, such as Google's two-step notification, offers some degree of control over applications, especially when utilizing the widely used mobile devices. The attributes that render smartphones effective authentication factors are the very characteristics that will empower devices like watches, wristbands, and thermostats to form opinions about our identity and assert that opinion. Confidentiality: The most recent technologies make messages susceptible to interception by outside parties in the IoT world. For instance, when a user accesses their homecare application from a public Wi-Fi network at a restaurant, live video content from their home becomes vulnerable to access by unauthorized third parties on the same network. Hence, ensuring confidentiality is paramount, and messages must remain concealed from intermediate entities. End-to-End (E2E) message secrecy emerges as a crucial requirement in the IoT landscape. Additionally, stored data, encompassing messages and personal information on IoT devices, must be safeguarded from unauthorized entities. Data Integrity: Remarkably, a significant portion of IoT research has directed its focus towards privacy, recognizing it as a crucial element in ensuring a secure IoT environment. Within any application, integrity stands out as a paramount component, surpassing even availability in importance. This emphasis is particularly critical in scenarios such as medical devices or a car's braking system, where a compromise in integrity could potentially result in severe consequences, even costing lives. Over the years, both Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) have played pivotal roles in ensuring data security, each with its own distinct and complementary functions. PKI excels in authentication and facilitating secure communication over networks, while KSI serves as a robust solution for ensuring integrity. Access Control: In conventional systems, access controls are typically designed for closed systems, where all users are familiar entities within the system. Given the significant role that unidentified entities play in the IoT, the approach needs to take into account both open and closed systems. Access control involves three decision factors along with two decision properties. 2.4 Need for communication security Implementing the security services mentioned in the previous section will help secure communication in the IoT, which is essential. The utilization of standardized security mechanisms enables the provision of communication security across various layers. Table 1 illustrates an IoT stack with standardized security solutions implemented at different layers. Link Layer: The most recent state-of-the-art security solution for the IoT is IEEE 802.15.4′s link layer security. This link-layer security operates on a per-hop basis, ensuring that each node in the communication path is trusted. A single pre-shared key is employed to safeguard all communication within this framework. In the event of a compromise, where an attacker gains access to one device and a key, the impact is limited to a single hop or device. This per-hop security approach not only minimizes the extent of potential compromise but also allows for detection at an early stage. While link layer security has its limitations, its flexibility is noteworthy, enabling it to operate seamlessly with multiple protocols across different layers. Network Layer: In the context of IoT, which is predominantly implemented over the internet, it relies on network IP Security (IPsec) provided at the network layer. IPsec delivers end-to-end security encompassing authentication, confidentiality, and integrity. Operating at the network layer, IPsec is compatible with various transport layer protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, and CoAP. Through the use of the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) protocol, IPsec ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the IP payload. Simultaneously, the Authentication Header (AH) protocol guarantees the integrity of both the IP header and payload. Notably, IPsec has become mandatory in all IPv6 protocols, signifying that all IPv6-ready devices inherently possess default support for IPsec. Data Security: Ensuring the security of communication is paramount in IoT, yet many application developers overlook the importance of securing the data generated by IoT devices. A significant challenge arises from the small size of most IoT devices, which imposes constraints on implementing robust security measures due to limited resources. While various solutions exist, the diverse communication technologies employed in the IoT suggest that a single solution may not suffice to comprehensively secure every aspect. 3 Security in IoT The significant impact of the IoT on daily life has spurred extensive research efforts aimed at enhancing its benefits for humanity. Numerous researchers have undertaken surveys to elucidate the intricacies of the IoT ecosystem. While some studies have focused on providing an overview of the challenges confronting IoT, others have delved into the realm of security threats. Several works, including [4–8], have reviewed security threats in IoT, addressing various types of attacks. For instance, [6] specifically highlighted security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth, shedding light on potential attacks leveraging these vulnerabilities within the IoT context. The challenges posed by IoT have been explored by researchers in works such as [4,9]. Additionally, [10] presented security guidelines, and the impact of 5 G on IoT systems. The architectural aspects of IoT, including its layers, were the focal point of [11], while different protocols were discussed in various works like [12–14]. Diverse applications of IoT, exemplified by [8], emphasized the transformative impact of smart logistics in industries. Given the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, there is a need for efficient and lightweight operations. This led to investigations into how edge computing, as illustrated in references [15,16], can facilitate the processing of IoT services such as smart agriculture and smart logistics. Authentication frameworks can be conceptualized through centralized methods or decentralized mechanisms, with decentralized solutions leveraging blockchain technology gaining attention in the research community, as evident in various review papers like [17–19]. In the realm of smart mobile IoT architecture, diverse security mechanisms were expounded upon in [20]. Conversely, intrusion detection solutions based on machine learning were illustrated in [20–22]. Notably, our research distinguishes itself by providing a comprehensive review of IoT attacks, encompassing taxonomy, attack surfaces, security mechanisms, secure data communication methods, and more. Table 1 succinctly outlines the contributions of different review papers, highlighting the unique perspective our paper brings to the landscape compared to other survey papers. 3.1 IoT internal security architecture Despite the significant and extensive applications of IoT, its deployment in mission-critical domains presents formidable challenges, with paramount concerns related to security and privacy. For instance, a successful security breach in a smart healthcare system could result in the loss of numerous patient lives and substantial financial repercussions. Similarly, in the context of intelligent transportation systems, a security breach could lead to both financial losses and human casualties. Securing IoT is an intricate and demanding field, necessitating further research efforts to effectively address these challenges. In this section, we delve into these security challenges at the layer level, providing an illustrated overview of IoT node security, as depicted in the accompanying Fig. 2 . Perceptual layer Security: Perceptual layer consists of resource constrained IoT devices i.e. Sensors, RFID tags, Bluetooth and Zigbee devices. These devices are more prone to cyber-attacks. As large amount of IoT devices is physically deployed in open fields, it encounters many physical attacks, which are presented in Table 2 . It is crucial to secure the IoT system from physical access by adversaries. Additionally, node authentication is necessary to prevent unauthorized system access. To ensure data integrity and confidentiality between nodes, lightweight cryptographic algorithms should be designed for secure transmission. Improving key management is a challenge in the IoT context. Network Layer Security: Even though the core network has adequate security measures, there are some problems that still persist. The integrity and confidentiality of data may be compromised if traditional security flaws are not addressed. There are many different kinds of network attacks that are still affecting the network layer, such as eavesdropping attacks, denial of service attacks, man-in-the middle attacks, and virus invasions. The detailed IoT attacks in the network layer are presented in Table 3 . While core network security is mature, harmful IoT security concerns such as denial of service and distributed denial of service must be addressed at this layer. Communication protocols must be mature to address routing attacks, congestion, and spoofing security issues. Support Layer Security: The security of the support layer is not dependent on the security of other layers, and cloud computing security is an expansive field of security. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is responsible for the establishment of many standard cloud security frameworks. In addition to this, the development of a mechanism for continuous cloud audit, such as the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), and the provision of trusted results through Trusted computing (TCG) is being worked on. Because this layer hosts the data and applications used by IoT users, it is imperative that both be safeguarded against unauthorized access. At this layer of security, some of the concerns include the table [tab:tab3]. IoT users’ data and applications are stored on cloud and fog nodes. Cloud security and privacy should not be compromised. The CSA has established numerous security standards, laws, and regulations for cloud security. Continuous monitoring of security standards is necessary, and IoT systems should only use clouds that meet CSA standards. Additionally, users need a simple online cloud audit mechanism to build trust with their vendors. Application Layer Security: At the application layer, the various applications each have their own unique set of security requirements. There is currently no agreed-upon standard for the construction of IoT applications. On the other hand, one of the characteristics of the IoT application layer is the sharing of data. The sharing of data is fraught with difficulties regarding data privacy and access control. The table [tab:tab4] presents some of the more common concerns regarding application layer security. It is necessary to have a robust authentication and access control mechanism in order to deal with application layer security. In addition to these, it is essential to instruct users on the importance of using robust passwords. It is necessary to have powerful anti-virus software in order to protect against malware. 3.2 IoT security requirements IoT offers a lot of benefits, but it also brings some challenges. These challenges include concerns over privacy, security vulnerabilities, and the digital divide. As IoT evolves, it is important to ensure that devices are secure, user privacy is respected, and technology is accessible to all. Since IoT devices collect, transmit, and process vast amounts of data, including sensitive personal information, it is crucial to secure these devices and their ecosystems. Implementing IoT applications requires essential security requirements such as end-to-end encryption, access control, privacy, authentication, resilience against attacks, data integrity, and availability, among others. Implementing these requirements demands a holistic approach that encompasses not only the technological aspects but also the processes and people involved. Security, privacy, authentication, and resilience should be integral to the design and operation of IoT systems, following the principle of \"security by design\" to anticipate and mitigate risks from the outset. Hence, adjusting the architecture of IoT applications is necessary to address the unique security challenges posed by IoT environments, including the complexity of IoT ecosystems, diverse communication protocols, data privacy concerns, integration with legacy systems, the dynamic nature of IoT environments, and regulatory compliance requirements. By implementing end-to-end security measures, organizations can mitigate risks and protect sensitive data across the entire IoT ecosystem, from device to cloud. To ensure the security of equipment, it is imperative to comprehend the fundamental security objectives. Traditional security principles, as encapsulated in the CIA triad, include confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality entails defining rules that establish criteria for authorized entities with access to information. Integrity plays a crucial role in ensuring the delivery of trustworthy services by making sure that IoT devices only receive legitimate commands and data. Furthermore, availability ensures that IoT functionalities remain accessible to legitimate objects and users at all times and in all locations. In the realm of Information Assurance and Security (IAS-octave), a comprehensive framework, an expanded set of security goals are introduced to address the limitations of the CIA triad and provide a more encompassing approach to security. IAS-octave expands on the original OCTAVE framework by providing an expanded set of security goals. These goals are designed to address various aspects of information assurance and security within an organization. With respect to IoT security, these security requirements are defined as follows: • End-to-End Encryption: Data transmitted between IoT devices and servers should be encrypted to prevent interception and unauthorized access. • Access Control: Implement strong access controls to limit who can interact with the IoT system and under what conditions. • Privacy: Users should be informed about what data is collected, how it is used, and who it is shared with, allowing for informed consent. • Device Authentication: Securely authenticate devices before they join the network to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting. • Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious activity and potential security breaches. • Data Integrity Protection: Implement mechanisms to ensure that data has not been tampered with during transmission or storage. These security goals provide a framework for IoT to evaluate their current security posture, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies and initiatives to enhance information assurance and security capabilities. By addressing these goals comprehensively, organizations can mitigate risks, protect critical assets, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems. 3.3 IoT vulnerabilities IoT devices have become integral to delivering enhanced consumer experiences and are omnipresent in our surroundings. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has given rise toto an escalating threat landscape in terms of security. Hackers are exploiting the vast network of interconnected devices, potentially compromising sensitive data. In the absence of robust security measures, IoT devices are susceptible to data breaches. What makes this situation even more concerning is that IoT and cybercriminal activities often operate inconspicuously, beyond the scope of ordinary observation, posing a constant threat. Moreover, IoT devices are particularly vulnerable to attacks and security risks due to their inherent limitations, including their affordability, low power capabilities, limited computing resources, and the sheer heterogeneity and scale of the IoT network. The vulnerability of IoT devices is not solely attributed to technical factors but also extends to user behavior. These factors collectively contribute to the ongoing risks associated with these smart devices. • Limited computing capabilities and hardware constraints: IoT devices are typically designed for specific applications with minimal processing power, leaving little room for robust security and data protection measures. • Heterogeneous transmission technology: IoT devices communicate with various devices using diverse communication technologies, making it challenging to establish consistent protection measures and protocols. • Vulnerable device components: Insecure or outdated fundamental components can leave millions of smart devices susceptible to harm. • User security awareness: Many users lack sufficient knowledge about security, exposing IoT devices to potential risks and attack vectors. Additionally, the integration of third-party apps on IoT devices can introduce further vulnerabilities. • Weak physical security: Unlike the secured data centers of internet services, many IoT components are physically accessible not only to users but also to individuals with malicious intent, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and tampering. Security concerns in the realm of IoT can be categorized into two main types: software-level threats and hardware-level threats. Software-level attacks, such as hacking, information leakage, and illegal access, aim to disrupt system functionality and gather sensitive information like credit card details and passwords. Employing security measures like firewalls, keeping virus databases updated, and using the latest software versions can help mitigate software-based attacks. However, the security landscape extends beyond software vulnerabilities, as hardware-level attacks also pose a significant risk. Ensuring complete hardware security requires the development of secure Integrated Circuits (ICs) or Systems on Chips (SoCs). This task has become increasingly complex due to the intricate nature of nano-scale design, the distributed fabrication of embedded Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips, and the incorporation of third-party Intellectual Property (IP) cores. The insertion of a single malicious circuit during the fabrication process can compromise the entire system, and such intrusions may remain imperceptible to the original designers. Defects within the components of a system can create vulnerabilities that broaden the attack surface. Adversaries often seek to exploit both the hardware and software of IoT systems to carry out malicious activities. According to a report by HP, approximately 50% of commercially available IoT devices exhibit significant security flaws. It is imperative to proactively address and respond to the vulnerabilities mentioned earlier, as they have the potential to expose sensitive information and compromise IoT systems. Given the IoT network's susceptibility to various forms of attacks, conducting comprehensive security analysis and implementing foolproof security measures is a complex undertaking. However, the substantial volume of data generated within IoT environments also contributes to enhancing the overall security level of the system. 3.4 Thread model Threat modeling facilitates the discovery of security flaws in computer systems and business processes. The thread model ensures that the system is not exposed to any potential vulnerabilities, which results in a heightened awareness of potential threats to system security [41]. IoT device networks are susceptible to newer security threats as a result of the challenges and issues that are associated with these networks. The requirements for security should be addressed at both the device level and the application level. The necessary precautions differ from one application to the next, as well as between domains. IoT devices have a limited amount of resources, which means that they are easily exploitable and could potentially serve as an entry point to the network. Each device that is part of the network needs to be shielded so that there is less of a chance that there will be a breach in the network's data integrity. Because breaches in networks serving critical applications can endanger people's lives and cause financial harm, higher levels of security are required for those applications. Examples of such applications include healthcare and banking systems. In [42], the cyberattack known as BrickerBot targeted healthcare applications. Attackers were successful in compromising the medical device and destroying the memory and data it contained with the assistance of this middleware, which they used to initiate a brute force method of attack. Tables 4 and 5 The impact of security attacks on the data systems of the IoT can range from minor to severe damage. The summary of device-level vulnerabilities and possible threats is presented in Table 6 for a selection of domains, including healthcare, business, and smart cities. The exponential growth in the number of connected devices around the world presents a formidable obstacle for identity and access management. In order to construct a trusted operating environment in which untrusted IoT devices can communicate and share information over an unsecured channel, it is essential to establish mutual authentication between IoT devices and servers and other access points. 4 Authentication schemes Authentication is one of the time-consuming tasks involved in determining the legitimacy of a remote user on a public network. Authentication is a critically important component in the overall security architecture of IoT applications. The different types of authentication mechanisms are broken down and categorized in Fig. 3 . Authentication requirements shift between layers in a hierarchical structure. Authentication issues pertaining to key management, confidentiality, and integrity, as well as software for the middleware, are tackled in the application layer. The application layer has a number of problems, including identity theft disclosure, desynchronization attacks, and a lack of forward secrecy. Stolen passwords are another problem. A four-way handshake method has been developed using a token-based approach to provide perfect forward secrecy (PFS) in RFID-based systems [43]. Using this interactive protocol, devices can be mutually authenticated for legitimate interactions. Due to the low-resource nature of IoT networks, complex authentication mechanisms cannot be employed. Authors in [44,45] developed a lightweight protocol that can resist collision attacks and DoS attacks. This method is computationally and communication-wise expensive but can withstand known security attacks. As presented in [46], the process of authenticating RFID tags can be made more complicated so that it can withstand attacks involving false nodes and other forms of impersonation. The authors in [47] found that using handshake methods, low-intensity authentication, and key agreement schemes were effective ways to accomplish efficient authentication and build trust in the system. To meet the demanding requirements of IoT applications, lightweight authentication protocols are currently in the process of being developed. Considering that these applications can process things and exchange information without the intervention of a human, authentication is becoming an increasingly important factor [48]. Recently developed cryptographic hash functions that are based on the Lightweight New Mersenne Number Transform (LNMNT) are ideal for providing security for IoT applications because of their lightweight nature. According to [49], these functions offer effective performance in terms of the amount of memory used, the amount of energy consumed, and the speed at which they are executed. The IoT and cloud computing platforms are combined to deliver more potent services, such as those referred to as Exchange to Exchange (E2E) and Smart to Smart (S2S) services. The number of security breaches, on the other hand, rises as a direct consequence of this integration, highlighting the ongoing requirement for a data delivery system that is both lightweight and effective. The authors in [50] found that this enabled better communication between a pair of IoT devices while also reducing the amount of power consumed and providing mutual authentication. There is a need for augmentation methods due to the fact that high bitwidth cryptographic algorithms cannot be accommodated in IoT devices [51]. These methods involve the use of commercial processors that have high computational capabilities. Authentication mechanisms that are both effective and efficient are required for hierarchical IoT networks. In these networks, nodes must have the ability to directly access real-time data. In addition to passing all of the security validations, the model should be able to guarantee anonymity and incorporate a mechanism for automatically upgrading software [52]. At the physical layer, authentication from one device to another is nearly impossible due to the fact that compromised credentials, such as passwords, can make an attacker appear to be a legitimate user. [53] says that to stop these kinds of attacks, physical layer authentication schemes and standard cryptographic algorithms with low overhead must work together without any problems. Existing encryption algorithms can be modified so that they are compatible with IoT devices that have limited resources. The authors in [54] found that even after algorithms such as AES were altered to work with the new hardware, they still maintained the same high level of security. The novel requirements of advanced IoT applications are beyond the capabilities of many of the existing security algorithms. According to [55], identity-based mutual authentication schemes that make use of puncturable pseudo-random functions can meet the requirements of mobile clients operating in an IoT environment. Tampering with the device and installing replacement nodes are two examples of potential physical threats to physical IoT devices. The author in [56] suggests that multi-stage mutual authentication mechanisms should be implemented in order to prevent attacks of this nature. Increasing the level of internal and external hardware security within a network can help improve device authentication and ensure secure communication between the various entities that make up a network. Electronic circuits that are designed to function in only one direction are known as physical unclonable functions, or PUFs for short. It takes the same inputs but applies them at different time intervals, and as a result, it produces two distinct outputs. Because of this, it is difficult to \"clone\" them. Yanambaka et al. [57] found that a robust authentication scheme that uses hybrid oscillator arbiter PUF can set up an authentication mechanism that is both more reliable and more quickly established. A PUF-based three-factor authentication system that uses biometrics, smart cards, and passwords is proposed by Liu et al. in [58]. This technique offers tamper resistance for IoT devices at a low cost and requires only a moderate amount of memory resources for computations. In [59], the authors present a proposal for a mutual authentication protocol that makes use of a hybrid arbiter and ring oscillator PUF. The session keys are generated and saved locally, either on the device or the server, when utilizing this method. An adversary may create a proxy to imitate the device's behavior and gain unauthorized access to the network in this way. According to [60], resource-efficient PUFs are used in the modeling of the protocols that protect the integrity of IoT hardware and software. After going through a process of mutual authentication, the devices are then able to communicate with one another by using PUFs. When utilizing hardware-based security protocols, the vital metrics that need to be taken into consideration include the physical area of the PUF, the amount of energy that is consumed, and the rate at which keys are generated [61]. It is essential to have mechanisms in place to verify remote users in order to engage in trustworthy communication and data sharing. According to Zhao et al. in [62], PUFs can serve as a foundation for the identification of various types of devices. In addition to this, the PUFs can serve as a source for the generation of cryptographic keys. The authors in [63] found that SRAM memories can be used to derive secret keys, which can then be used for encryption and decryption procedures. Standard algorithms, such as AES, can be utilized, along with the keys that are generated by PUFs, in order to encrypt the data. The challenge-response (CR) pairs that are used for enrollment and other purposes such as validation and verification have the potential to become access points for model-based attacks. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of CR-pairs, the same encryption mechanisms can be utilized, as stated in [64]. In recent years, blockchain technology has garnered a lot of attention for its ability to provide a safe and reliable environment for the storage of data and the exchange of information. Through the utilization of digital contracts, the blockchain platform enables the safe transfer of data. These contracts are used to authenticate the users, which also provides role-based access control to the system. In some applications, like vehicular networks, broadcasting forged messages to attract user attention poses a threat to users’ privacy as well as their ability to authenticate themselves. According to Khan et al. in [65], it is of the utmost importance in anonymous networks to both discover the true identities of participants and protect their privacy. A blockchain is used to store the data so that its veracity as well as its privacy can be preserved. As a result, this system offers a protected framework through the utilization of a distributed blockchain network. The blockchain is entirely independent in that it does not involve any third parties in its operations. Before being allowed to share the data, the nodes and any other entities involved, therefore, have to carefully authenticate themselves. As mentioned in [66], effective methods of identity management and authentication are necessary in order to safeguard both the availability and integrity of data. In applications such as vehicular networks, traceability and the privacy of user data are both absolutely necessary. Pseudonyms and methods for tracing anonymous messages sent from malicious nodes are two of the techniques that are required in order to provide trusted communications in an environment where there is a lack of trust between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. According to Zheng et al. in [67], blockchain technology may be able to provide assistance in meeting these essential requirements. The medical and healthcare platforms are examples of domains that have made optimal use of the benefits and innovations offered by IoT networks, thereby realizing their full potential. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to the collection of medical devices that are connected to the internet. These devices contain sensors that are interfaced to them in order to collect vital patient body parameters such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Depending on the device, the sensors send their collected data via wired or wireless communication networks to a central server. The physicians can use this information to evaluate the performance of the remote patient as well as the patient's current state of recovery, and they can also prescribe additional medication. By utilizing encryption and the built-in tamper-proof architecture that the blockchain \"citexu2019healthchain\" provides, a blockchain network enables the establishment of mutual authentication among users as well as data privacy. Innovation and healthcare go hand in hand, with the former being applied to medical diagnosis and treatment. As mentioned in [68], because every procedure in the system is saved as an immutable record, users are unable to make any changes to them. The healthcare applications include things like tracking devices used by patients, billing insurance companies, and settling payments with pharmacies. Authentication and privacy protection mechanisms are necessities for any negotiations to take place between these entities. Another study [69] suggests that the transaction speed within the blockchain needs to be increased in order to ensure smooth and trouble-free transactions within the network. The data gathered from patients by healthcare applications may be stored on-chain or off-chain, depending on the provider's preference. The paper [70] recommends exercising caution whenever data from this storage is shared in order to protect the confidentiality of the data and stop unauthorized access. Further, some important solutions that address the authentication issues have been summarized in Table 7 . 4.1 Open research dimensions in authentication Comparing existing surveys and looking at the different authentication methods and tools that make them work shows a number of useful research directions in the area of IoT and its security. The drawbacks associated with the discussed authentication methods across different sections underscore the necessity for ongoing research efforts as IoT applications continue to diversify. Addressing these shortcomings, contingent on the specific application domains, will be a crucial task for future researchers. These identified limitations serve as a foundation for defining research problems that must be tackled to enhance the maturity and sustainability of IoT security in the future. These open research problems offer valuable guidance for algorithm developers, industry professionals, and academia. Building upon the discussions in the preceding sections, here we provide a consolidated list of directions for future research endeavors. Architectural aspects: The review of research works underscores the prevalence of the three-layered architecture as the most widely adopted IoT framework. While other architectures are available, they have not received significant research attention thus far. The concept of a five-layered architecture emerges as a potential candidate for future IoT frameworks. Observations indicate that as IoT functionalities expand, designers introduce additional layers to accommodate various operations. These supplementary layers indeed provide finer granularity to the system. However, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dependencies to define security requirements effectively and apply appropriate methods. Therefore, it becomes imperative to thoroughly grasp the merits and drawbacks of these architectural choices, enabling the association of well-defined functions with each layer to harness their architectural advantages optimally. Security requirements: The authentication of both the sender and the data is a fundamental requirement for ensuring secure communication. In addition to this, employing an attestation process is essential to upholding both the integrity and authentication of the transmitted information. For instance, implementing remote attestation for IIoT-related patches and software updates is crucial. While several remote authentication methods are already in existence, there remains room for further advancements in this domain, particularly in the context of adopting decentralized frameworks. Decentralization aspects: Authentication is typically established through the use of digital signatures, which rely on cryptographic keys. In conventional systems, the process of key generation is centralized and susceptible to potential failures. Researchers have already commenced investigations into distributed key generation processes, but further advancements are required to make them applicable in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, in authentication schemes based on blockchain technology, achieving consensus poses a significant challenge. It is imperative to explore lightweight consensus mechanisms or alternatives like \"proof of X\" for such authentication methods. Requirement of randomness: Reports from security protocol developers and NIST requirements have emphasized the need for the creation of robust random and pseudo-random number generators. In contemporary security protocols, the absence of reliable random numbers poses a significant challenge. Consequently, there is a demand for the development of simpler yet effective random number generators. Another facet of future research involves integrating these random numbers into security algorithms and analyzing their impact on the behavior of existing security protocols. Authentication phase aspects: The survey provided a clear depiction of the infrequent use of authentication protocols with four to eight phases. Although these multi-phase structures were initially introduced with the aim of improving efficiency, they have encountered several drawbacks, which have hindered their adoption in the research domain. It is crucial to identify the underlying reasons for these challenges and to develop algorithms or functions that can help rejuvenate these phase structures. Moreover, it's important to acknowledge that an increased number of phases within a single operation, such as authentication, can potentially elevate complexity and resource consumption. This heightened complexity may, in turn, jeopardize the overall system's performance and lead to potential failures. Authentication type aspects: Both IoTs and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have incorporated generic and standard security protocols to deliver authentication services. Industrial IoT (IIoT) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have also adopted this approach and have even ventured into developing customized authentication methods tailored to their specific domains. However, as devices become increasingly sophisticated and resource-constrained, the demand for security protocols has shifted from generic solutions to lightweight and even ultra-lightweight alternatives. In the future, security protocol designers should prioritize the development of robust algorithms that offer both lightweight and ultra-lightweight features. This is essential to meet the evolving needs of these diverse IoT domains while ensuring the security and efficiency of their operations. Attack orientation: The survey conducted in this research work underscores the vulnerabilities of IoT systems to a range of security threats, including de-synchronization attacks, message modification attacks, cloning attacks, masquerading problems, node compromise issues, wormhole problems, and smart card vulnerabilities. Despite the recognition of these threats, research efforts to mitigate and address such attacks have not received substantial attention, leaving ample room for advancement in future research endeavors. Password problem: The global challenge of passwords affects the security of IoT systems, as the trade-off between usability and security continues to impact their effectiveness. One-time passwords (OTPs) also fall within this spectrum, introducing additional concerns related to phishing when combined with shared secret practices. Consequently, IoTs are in search of a comprehensive authentication system that can effectively address these multifaceted problems. Authentication requirements: Authentication protocols in IoT systems necessitate certain properties, namely backward secrecy and anonymity, to ensure robust authentication features. However, these two critical attributes have not received extensive research attention and require significant focus for enhancement. Furthermore, lightweight end-to-end authentication methods are highly favored in the context of IoT systems. Authentication overhead: Creating an authentication protocol might seem straightforward, but crafting an efficient one is a challenging endeavor. An efficient authentication protocol should not introduce unnecessary overhead by exchanging an excessive number of messages. In the context of IoTs, this challenge is exacerbated as the number of devices increases, causing a significant rise in message exchanges. Furthermore, the message size should be kept to a minimum. Therefore, authentication protocol designers must strike a balance by utilizing a limited number of messages with efficient size constraints to enhance the productivity of the authentication system. Post-quantum sustainability: The advancement of quantum computing poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of existing cryptosystems. To ensure the resilience of authentication protocols, designers must prioritize the development of quantum-resistant constructions for authentication keys or their derivatives. Privacy-awareness: Privacy is an integral component of security, and even an authenticated entity can potentially compromise the privacy of data. Consequently, researchers should focus on designing an authentication mechanism that can effectively safeguard privacy. Moreover, it's essential to consider the interdependencies of various privacy parameters when developing authentication solutions. Authorization integration: It is a common observation that legitimate users can be more susceptible to misusing the authorization process. Detecting such misuse can be challenging, especially when a user is authenticated but not properly authorized for a specific operation. Many authentication methods primarily focus on verifying the identity of nodes or users and often treat authorization as an assumed or separate module. Nevertheless, an optimal approach is to integrate an authentication mechanism that seamlessly incorporates authorization features, creating a coherent and unified process for both authentication and authorization. Scalability: In the literature, it's a common trend to find authentication schemes claiming to be scalable. However, these claims often fall short of validation in real-world scenarios. Hence, it becomes imperative to establish a clear and substantiated correlation between these authentication schemes and scalability, backed by valid proofs and evidence. Authentication as a service (AaaS): Authentication as a Service (AaaS) offers a range of authentication services, including multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and password management in the cloud. While cloud-based solutions provide these authentication services, they also inherit inherent security vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches. Therefore, there is a need to further develop efficient AaaS solutions that explicitly address and enhance cloud security. These aforementioned aspects of future research work play a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainable development of the IoT environment. They must be given significant attention to enhance the efficiency of IoT applications. Future researchers should actively consider these challenges and issues when working on IoT advancements, whether in the form of services or products. Achieving robust authentication in IoT applications is crucial for verifying the identity of devices and users, ensuring that only authorized entities can access the network, data, and services. Implementing effective authentication mechanisms in IoT applications requires careful consideration of the specific requirements and constraints of the IoT ecosystem, including device capabilities, network architecture, and the sensitivity of the data being protected. A layered approach, combining multiple authentication methods, often provides the best defense against unauthorized access, ensuring that IoT systems remain secure and trustworthy. In conclusion, this survey suggests some important technologies and methods for strengthening authentication in IoT ecosystems. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Certificates utilize a system of digital certificates, incorporating public and private keys, to authenticate devices securely within IoT environments. By verifying each other's trusted Certificate Authority (CA)-issued digital certificates, this system enables devices to mutually authenticate, facilitating secure communications. To further bolster security, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) demands two or more verification forms from different credential categories, such as knowledge (passwords), possession (security tokens or smart cards), and inherence (biometric verification like fingerprints or facial recognition). Additionally, OAuth and token-based authentication provide secure mechanisms for authorizing device access to services and resources without sharing passwords, using standards like OAuth for access delegation and tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens, JWT) for managing sessions and information transmission securely. In addition to these, two-step verification, which combines a password with another verification method like an SMS or app-generated code, adds an additional layer of security similar to MFA. For physical device security, Secure Elements (SEs) offer a tamper-resistant platform for securely hosting applications and their cryptographic data, enabling secure storage of digital keys and cryptographic operations on IoT devices. Similarly, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) provide a secure cryptoprocessor that can securely store cryptographic keys used for authentication, ensuring these keys remain protected outside the TPM's environment. Together, these technologies form a comprehensive framework for enhancing the authentication and security of devices within the IoT, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and other security threats. 5 Access control and data privacy models The IoT focuses primarily on facilitating the unbroken exchange of data across a variety of platforms. Security measures, including access control and data privacy, are managed at the local network level in IoT networks because these networks do not use standard architectures or protocols. Access control mechanisms are utilized in order to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the system's resources, which may include data, hardware, and software applications. These resources may include access to the system. Fig. 4 presents an overarching categorization of the various access control mechanisms. The administrator of the network has the ability to set a limit on the number of users who have access to the network resources and to keep a list of authorized users thanks to access control mechanisms that are discretionary in nature. The list is kept up-to-date over the course of some time, and access is granted according to the privileges that are currently available. Only administrators and managers will be able to access the resources when mandatory access control mechanisms are in place, because access will be denied to any other users. The operations can only be performed by a select group of users, despite the fact that this access control mechanism is the most secure one. These days, the most common type of access control mechanism, particularly in applications based on the IoT, is the role-based model. Users have access to the resources they need based on the roles they play in their organizations, making role-based access control a more flexible form of access control. There are a number of additional mechanisms that enable the modification of permissions in accordance with a predetermined set of rules, so rule-based access control mechanisms do not exist in a vacuum. There is a potential for data loss and disruption of service due to the inability of centralized access control mechanisms to scale to meet the demands of ever-growing IoT applications. In today's world, centralized mechanisms have taken on a significant role. The paper [78] describes the non-blockchain as a distributed access control mechanism that does not put its faith in centralized authorities having control over end users. Another research study [79] provides an illustration of one of these mechanisms by referring to organization-based distributed control access control. Blockchain technology offers individualized solutions to a variety of security challenges, including access control. Access to the resources is granted on the basis of the information contained in the response's header regarding the access control mechanism, which, in the case of policy-header-based access control, is where the authorization information is stored. As was covered in the chapter before this one, smart contracts are composed of coded sets of agreements that, once satisfied, grant access to the resources. Token-based access control involves providing authorized users with tokens that contain particular validation rules and time stamps. These tokens are unique to each user. At the time of access, the system verifies the token, and only users who have tokens that are still valid are granted permission to access the resources. Computing in the cloud is one of the key technologies that made it possible to build the IoT. The vast majority of the data generated by IoT applications is kept in the cloud, where user applications can connect to it in order to better serve the requirements of end users. The use of attribute-based signatures, also known as ABS schemes, can be beneficial for both controlling access and maintaining data privacy. The paper [58] reports that lightweight versions of these schemes are currently being developed for a wide variety of applications in order to accomplish the goals of unforgeability and anonymity. In certain applications, such as healthcare, it is absolutely necessary to validate the authenticity of the user. The data authenticators could be validated by using lightweight protocols that were deployed at the edges of the network in order to protect data privacy and prevent unauthorized access [80]. As a result of the fact that cloud services can be accessed through public networks like the internet, they are at risk of being subject to severe security breaches. Although the cloud offers blackbox security measures, it is possible that these safeguards are not suitable for all applications. Access control and privacy concerns for applications dealing with sensitive data, such as those dealing with healthcare and finances, have been addressed with the help of reputation-based mechanisms [81]. In an environment like this, trust plays a critical role, and the paper [82] proposes defining a set of parameters at various levels in order to perform periodic evaluations of the system. Internet applications make extensive use of systems known as public key infrastructure (PKI), which are designed to protect the confidentiality of both data and communications. On the other hand, resource-constrained IoT networks are unable to make use of them because the PKI necessitates intensive computing and memory requirements. A recently developed lightweight compact certificate was designed to be suitable for IoT applications [83]. The work [84] explains that novel key derivation procedures that make use of fuzzy logic extractors and lightweight encryption algorithms can be combined together to simplify access control mechanisms and make them suitable for resource-limited networks. Techniques like division computation over encrypted data with privacy provisioning have become increasingly popular to serve the access control and privacy needs of the IoT networks [80]. Access control in a blockchain environment can be implemented in a variety of different ways. The utilization of smart contracts enables the provision of mechanisms for role-based access control. These contracts are deployed on blockchain platforms and written in the Solidity programming language. Each transaction that takes place within the network triggers the execution of a smart contract, and access to the network is granted only to authentic users who have passed validation. Every user has a role that is assigned to them, and the permissions they have are determined by that role [85,86]. All of the relations are mapped to the internal data structures using the coded rules that are contained within the smart contracts. According to [87], blockchain networks naturally incorporate security features such as the provenance of data and the confidentiality of transactions. The introduction of blockchain technology and the increased level of security it provides have brought about revolutionary improvements in a variety of industrial applications. In order to improve safety while continuing to take advantage of the innovative solutions offered by the IoT, many IIoT applications are being converted into blockchain-based applications [88]. Sharing electronic healthcare records, also known as EHRs, is one of the most significant challenges facing healthcare platforms [89]. Motes, which have a slow computational speed and a limited amount of memory, are used in body area networks (BANs). They are utilized to collect vital signs from the patient's body and convey this information to the central authorities in charge of the operation. According to the paper [90], the use of specialized verification schemes and digital signatures is a viable option for achieving both access control and data security. For IoT networks with limited resources, it is possible to implement security mechanisms such as the outsourced calculation of rational numbers that protect users’ privacy and allow for secure data sharing and access. Utilizing these strategies could prevent data from becoming accessible to unauthorized users [58]. According to [91], there are a large number of decentralized algorithms and other blockchain mechanisms that can be customized to fit the needs of IoT applications while maintaining the same level of data privacy and security. Table 8 provides a summary of some significant contributions made to the access control and privacy aspects of blockchain technology and the IoT. 5.1 Open research issues in access control Access control has a rich history of research and development, with several access control models having been effectively implemented in real-world applications. However, as IoT technologies continue to evolve, different information resources are becoming deeply integrated for extensive use. The distinctive characteristics of IoT systems, including node heterogeneity, open environments, and the sharing of resources among multiple parties, introduce new requirements for access control models and mechanisms. Despite these challenges, many research endeavors have concentrated on introducing innovative models and mechanisms that enable fine-grained access control in IoT systems and their associated resources. Nevertheless, there remain numerous important issues and challenges that demand further attention and resolution. Policy Conflict Caused by Different Authorizations: In this article, various access control models designed for IoT environments were introduced, including RBAC and ABAC. Several proposals related to RBAC have centered on integrating interpersonal relationships into access decision-making processes. However, these proposals frequently ignore the characteristics of multiparty resource sharing and assume that resources belong to a single entity. Conversely, numerous ABAC-related proposals have employed a straightforward approach to tackle this situation, requiring access to be authorized only when all users grant approval. Yet, this strategy can be overly restrictive for real-world applications, as it may limit resource availability. To address these challenges, more extensive efforts are necessary to concentrate on resolving policy conflicts arising from diverse authorizations. Such efforts can significantly enhance the automation of policy composition and conflict resolution, making access control in the IoT more adaptable and practical for real-world applications. Policy Conflict Caused by Multiparty Relationships: The challenge of policy conflicts arises due to the distinctive characteristics of the IoT search environment. When integrating multiparty access control policies, the policies of different agents often include numerous constraints. For a given resource, different owners may impose varying constraints on its access. As a result, several access control decisions may emerge, each aligning with the requirements of individual users. However, these decisions can sometimes be mutually exclusive. The amalgamation of these constraints frequently leads to inconsistencies and conflicts. Hence, finding efficient and dynamic methods to swiftly select and adjust access control decisions for diverse users is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. Attribute-Permission Assignment Within Noise Data:IoT search operates within a multidomain collaborative environment where different access control policies are utilized in distinct domains. To establish unified policy management, it is often necessary to convert other access control models into the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. ABAC relies on attributes as its core components, and access control decisions are based on the set of attributes that the requester possesses. This characteristic makes ABAC particularly well-suited for the IoT search environment, as it effectively segregates policy management from access control decision-making. The process of converting other policy types into ABAC entails creating high-quality attribute-permission correspondences, primarily based on role-permission and user-permission relationships. Notably, original user-permission relations may contain noise data, significantly impacting the accuracy of policy generation and introducing substantial security risks to access control systems. Addressing the assignment of attribute-permission relationships within noisy data represents a substantial research challenge in the realm of access control for IoT search. Modeling and Evaluation of IoT Security Search: It is imperative to maintain a balance between quality, security, and efficiency throughout the process of IoT search. The escalating growth of IoT has brought increased focus to its security. Over the past decades, modeling and simulation (MS) techniques have effectively addressed various complex security challenges. Given that IoT possesses a distinctive address and relies on standard communication protocols, MS methods and tools are well-suited for addressing IoT-related issues. Despite this, there has been limited exploration into the modeling and evaluation of IoT security searches. Authentication and Anonymous Protection of Physical Devices in the IoT: Within industrial control security IoT, numerous authentication methods are developed to facilitate real-time communication between the cloud platform and sensing devices. However, often, these methods face a challenge in simultaneously ensuring both efficiency and security. Consequently, there is a need for increased emphasis on the technology related to device authentication and anonymity protection. This emphasis is crucial to guaranteeing the trustworthiness of data sources, preserving privacy, and maintaining data availability. 6 Scalability models Scalability is the primary issue that arises with IoT networks. In order to keep the system in a state of equilibrium, the network will need to modify itself to accommodate the growing number of nodes and the volume of traffic. When connected to blockchain networks, IoT devices bring an exponential increase in the severity of this problem. Because each transaction needs to be validated before it is added to the block and then stored at every node in the network, blockchains are unable to accommodate the growing number of transactions generated by the IoT. According to the paper [98] some ineffective ways of increasing scalability include increasing the block size and reducing the amount of time spent on the consensus protocol. Researchers from all over the world have come up with a variety of solutions to address the scalability issues, and this section will discuss a few of those solutions. LPWAN, which stands for low-power wide area networks, is one of the technologies that made it possible for the Internet to exist. Scalability is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to meet the demanding requirements of an increasing number of applications for the IoT. According to the paper [70], increasing scalability can be accomplished through the seamless integration of polynomial-based optimization techniques into these networks. Some of the obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve scalability include interoperability, deployability, and the absence of standard communication protocols. The scalability of the system can be improved to some degree [99] by making it possible for edge devices to conform to the modular properties of the applications. Scalability in the IoT can be attributed, in large part, to the fact that the majority of its applications are geared toward centralized cloud servers. The authors in [100] found that, as a consequence of this, blockchain-based decentralized applications exhibited superior scalability. Altering the data structures already present within the blockchain to better suit the needs of the application is yet another method for increasing the system's capacity to scale. The corresponding algorithms are developed in order to gain access to and process these structures, thereby reducing the amount of time necessary for the processing of the blocks contained within the blockchain. The paper [101] explains that the scalability of transactions can be improved in this way. As IoT devices are incapable of executing complex consensus algorithms, direct integration of blockchain and IoT is not possible. Instead, a local loop network can serve as an interface between these two networks to facilitate communication. The authors in [102] found that the transaction rate could be increased by relieving blockchain of the additional burden of processing data from IoT devices. According to the paper \"cite\" tang2022coordinate, techniques like source look-up techniques and discovery techniques can reduce the communication overhead. Security from beginning to end and scalable data sensing mechanisms are prerequisites for systems that have more stringent requirements for the collection of data, the flow of data from one entity to another, and the storage of data. According to the paper [103], a more effective strategy for accomplishing the goal of achieving the required level of scalability is to design infrastructures that are capable of being configured in order to collect and exchange data. According to the paper [104], algorithms that cut down on the amount of time needed for validation and consensus processes also make valuable contributions to improving scalability. In addition, scalability can be improved by utilizing scheduling and synchronization mechanisms [105]. These mechanisms give users greater access while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of collisions. According to the paper [106], the quality of the services that are offered to final users can be adjusted to better meet their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Access control is vital for securing the vast network of devices in the IoT. In conclusion, this survey suggests some key technologies used to achieve robust access control in the IoT. Authentication serves as the critical layer that determines the identity of a user or device attempting to access a resource, employing mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, and digital certificates to ensure security. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are utilized to define specific rules that either permit or restrict access to resources for particular users or devices; for instance, an ACL might enable a user to view but not modify sensor data. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) takes a different approach by assigning permissions according to predefined roles, meaning a \"maintenance technician\" might have the authority to reboot devices but not to change their configurations. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) provides an even finer level of control by evaluating attributes like location, time, or device type, potentially restricting thermostat access to authorized devices within the office network during work hours. The management of access control has traditionally been centralized, relying on a central server; however, distributed models offer an alternative by allowing devices to independently make access decisions based on established rules, thereby diminishing the dependency on a central authority and enhancing system resilience. 7 Conclusion and future directions In this paper, the methods that are currently available in the literature are discussed, and this paper also presents the methods that are currently available. The subsequent step is an in-depth discussion of the numerous security risks and the importance of threat modeling. The subsequent topic is a discussion of the various IoT applications’ necessary security precautions. It reviews the prior research on the numerous security issues and the solutions put forth by various researchers. The holes that were found while conducting this literature review served as inspiration for the current research work. 7.1 Research challenges The billions of IoT devices deployed across the globe collect personal and sensitive data and exchange it with other networks using intelligent interfaces. Providing device authentication, authorization, data privacy, and security in such an un trusted environment is a challenge. Centralized trusted infrastructure cannot scale to the dynamic and ever intensifying traffic and, thus, leading to bottlenecks in the network. Distributed authentication can scale to the increasing demands of the IoT networks, but requires distributed trusted systems. The majority of the work in the IoT security domain focuses on embracing the security mechanisms of WSNs and conventional Internet-based applications. However, these mechanisms are far from being implemented in real-time scenarios due to the specific challenges of IoT, such as Scalability With the number of IoT devices installed surpassing the total world human population, designing scalable architectures that cater to the demanding needs of the broad spectrum of IoT applications is the need of the hour. Device Heterogeneity The IoT nodes operate on different hardware and operating system platforms and use different sets of protocols for communication and other purposes. The quality of service (QoS) requirements are also different for different services, or for the same set of services, there may be different modes of operation. Interoperability, which allows a device to communicate and exchange information with other devices across various networks, emerges from the challenges posed by heterogeneity and the absence of standardized protocols and architectures within IoT networks. In the early stages of research focused on IoT security, a thorough literature review highlighted several notable deficiencies in current state-of-the-art approaches. Among these are the need for a lightweight mechanism that can facilitate secure communication and data sharing in IoT networks constrained by limited resources. Additionally, there is a crucial demand for improved access control and data privacy measures to protect sensitive information. Furthermore, the development of user and IoT device authentication methods is essential for establishing a trusted operating environment, underscoring the gaps that future research must address to enhance IoT security. Resource Limited By design, most the IoT devices have low memory and low computational processing ability. They operate on battery power in harsh environments. The distributed nature of the resources The resources in the IoT network are distributed to provide different functionalities, cooperation, and data classification based on applications. 7.2 Future directions The integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, and blockchain into IoT ecosystems significantly enhances their security. Each of these technologies addresses specific vulnerabilities and brings unique strengths to the security architecture of IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in IoT security, offering capabilities such as anomaly detection, adaptive threat response, and automated security. ML algorithms excel at processing extensive datasets generated by IoT devices, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies, which are crucial for early breach detection and intervention. Over time, ML can adapt to new threats dynamically, offering superior threat detection and response compared to static measures. Moreover, ML automation reduces manual oversight, enhancing security efficiency and response speed. Fog computing, operating closer to data sources, reduces latency in threat detection and response, mitigating risks faster. By processing data locally, fog computing minimizes the attack surface and follows a decentralized security model, enhancing resilience against attacks. Edge computing further strengthens IoT security by processing data at the source, reducing data transit risks, and enabling real-time security actions. It optimizes resources by empowering devices to autonomously analyze data, enhancing privacy and security. Blockchain technology reinforces security and trust within IoT ecosystems through its secure, immutable ledger, resistant to tampering and fraud. Its decentralized approach mitigates single points of failure, enhancing network resilience while enabling secure, transparent transactions between devices, essential for secure machine-to-machine interactions.
